WHY?

WHY?

Why, when the United Nations IPCC is totally refuted…
When Al Gore is totally discredited…
When man-made global warming is totally debunked…
When passing a global warming cap and trade is totally futile…
Why is this book necessary?
Very simple: the environmental activist extremists are not going away.
They are committed to their crown jewel—cap and trade. Whether by

treaty, legislation or regulation, this largest tax increase in American history
must become a reality for them.

And while the public has caught on and believes the global warming issue

is dead, President Obama and the left in Congress are proceeding as if
nothing has happened, inserting expensive CO2 emission controls in virtually
every piece of legislation and regulation.

While in the fall of 2011, the House, the Senate, and the Super Committee

got all the public attention on a spending reduction of one trillion dollars
over ten years, the extremists are pushing an agenda that would cost the
American taxpayers three trillion dollars in that same ten years. And it has
gone almost completely unnoticed for two reasons: one, the media is
obsessed with resurrecting the Gore mantra and, two, MoveOn.org, George
Soros, Michael Moore, and the Hollywood elites have the resources to
reverse the defeat and preserve their crown jewel. And they will do it with
or without President Obama.

This book constitutes the wake-up call for America—the first and only
complete history of The Greatest Hoax, who is behind it, the true motives,
how we can defeat it—and what will happen if we don’t.

Somebody had to do it.

INTRODUCTION

THE HOAX DEBUNKED: DON’T FEEL TOO

SORRY FOR AL GORE

“With all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be
that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the

American people? It sure sounds like it.”

—Senator Jim Inhofe, July 29, 20031

SINCE JULY 2003, when I stood alone on the Senate floor and declared that
man-made catastrophic global warming was the greatest hoax ever
perpetrated on the American people, the credibility of the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—which claimed to have
a “consensus” on global warming—has eroded; cap and trade is dead and
never to be resurrected, and, the belief that anthropogenic global warming is
leading to catastrophe is all but forgotten. With the total collapse of the
biggest campaign of his life, one might feel a bit sorry for Al Gore. Almost.

Reprinted with permission

When the Climategate scandal (which includes both the leaked

Climategate emails and the errors in the IPCC science that were discovered
in the wake of these emails) revealed that several of the world’s top climate
researchers were alleged to be cooking the science, Al Gore, the world’s
first potential climate billionaire was running for cover.

When he resurfaced months later with a nearly 2,000 word op-ed in the

New York Times, the fact that he was in denial was clearly evident in the title
of his piece: “We Can’t Wish Away Climate Change.”2 I hated to break it to
him, but global warming alarmism was long dead and buried at that stage.

His op-ed was all about the so-called “overwhelming consensus,” China,
solar and wind power, globalization, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and
cap and trade—all topics that the American people no longer saw as
relevant, especially in a weak economy.

What was Gore’s take on the Climategate scandal? Climate scientists, he

wrote in that same op-ed, were “besieged” by an “onslaught” of hostile
information requests from climate “skeptics.” He called those who question
climate alarmism members of a “criminal generation,” and said in a separate
interview that these emails were just “sound and fury signifying nothing.” Yet
the Daily Telegraph,3 one of largest publications in the United Kingdom, said
it was the worst scientific scandal of our generation. The Atlantic Monthly,4
the Financial Times,5 the New York Times,6 Newsweek,7 Time8 and many
others, conceded that it was a legitimate scandal and that reform of the IPCC
is absolutely essential.

The fact that Time magazine was one of the publications closely

reviewing the Climategate scandal is important because this is the same
publication that in 1974 told us that another ice age was coming, and we
were all going to die.9 And everyone remembers the Time magazine cover
during the height of the alarmism campaign that pictured the last polar bear
standing on the last cube of ice saying that we should all be worried, very
worried about global warming.10 So even a publication that has unabashedly
promoted alarmism over both global cooling and warming was taking this
scandal very seriously.

One of Gore’s former global warming allies, President Barack Obama,
has since received the message that global warming is no longer politically
popular. Of course, the President was the one who sold his cap and trade
agenda during the 2008 Presidential campaign as the only way to save the
planet from catastrophe, promising that generations from now “we will be
able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment… when the
rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”11 He vowed
that the United States would sign an international treaty with binding limits
on greenhouse gases, and he promised that a cap and trade bill would be
signed into law. But in a rare moment of clarity, then-Senator Obama openly
revealed the hoax for what it is, admitting, “if somebody wants to build a
coal-fired plant they can. It’s just that it will bankrupt them” and “under my

plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily
skyrocket.”12

The central fact about cap and trade is inescapable: as the President said

himself, it’s designed to make the energy we use more expensive. Cap and
trade would have been the largest tax increase in American history. It would
have made electricity, food, and gasoline prices significantly more
expensive, and it would have destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs and
further weakened the already fragile economy. The Wharton Econometric
Forecasting Associates (or WEFA13) and Charles Rivers and Associates14
found that the Kyoto Treaty would have cost the U.S. between $300 billion
and $400 billion annually to implement. Cap and trade would have around
the same pricetag. To put this in perspective, the Clinton-Gore tax increases
of 1993, which were set at $30 billion, were the largest tax increases in
American history. Cap and trade would have been ten times that amount.

What would Americans actually gain environmentally for all the economic

pain they would be forced to endure? One would think that at the very least
we would save the world from climate catastrophe. Not exactly. When
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa Jackson testified
before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, she admitted to
me that the United States acting alone on global warming would have no
impact whatsoever on global carbon levels.15 Administrator Jackson’s
comment echoes the work of Dr. Tom Wigley, one of Al Gore’s own
scientists, who said in 1997 that even if the Kyoto Protocol were fully
implemented by all signatories, it would only reduce global temperatures by
0.06 degrees Celsius by 2050.16 Such a small amount is hardly even
measurable.

The results of such a plan are obvious: as jobs go to places like India,

China, and Mexico, where they don’t have any emissions requirements, much
less the environmental standards we have in the United States, cap and trade
would actually increase worldwide emissions. So in the end, it would have
been all pain for no environmental gain.

President Obama no longer speaks about global warming, much to the

disappointment of Al Gore, who in a June 2011 Rolling Stone article called
“Climate of Denial” said,

President Obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the
case for bold action on climate change. After successfully passing his
green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress
decimated its funding. After the House passed cap and trade, he did little
to make passage in the Senate a priority […] The failure to pass
legislation to limit global-warming pollution ensured that the much-
anticipated Copenhagen summit on a global treaty in 2009 would also
end in failure.17

But even though global warming hysteria and cap and trade are long dead,

the fight is far from over because President Obama is now moving forward
with a plan to achieve through regulation what could not be achieved through
legislation. In December of 2009, the Obama EPA issued what is called the
“endangerment finding”—a finding that greenhouse gases harm public health
and welfare.18 Armed with this “finding” the EPA is planning to regulate
greenhouse gases instead through the Clean Air Act, which was never meant
to regulate carbon. Like cap and trade, this plan will have the same
$300-$400 billion pricetag, it will put the same amount of jobs in jeopardy,
and it will cause the same amount of havoc for our economy. My fight today
is to stop them from achieving this cap and trade agenda through the back
door.

Unfortunately for Americans, the endangerment finding is just the

beginning. The Obama EPA now has the distinction of implementing and
overseeing the most aggressive regulatory regime in American history, and,
like cap and trade, it is aimed squarely at regulating traditional and
domestically abundant sources of energy like coal, oil, and natural gas out of
existence. The EPA is moving forward with an unprecedented number of
rules for coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers that have now
become known as the infamous “train wreck” for the incredible harm they
will do to our economy. They are set to destroy hundreds of thousands of
jobs, and significantly raise energy prices for families, businesses, and
farmers—basically anyone who drives a car, operates heavy machinery, or
flips a switch.

Indeed, from farm dust to puddles of water on the road, there are very few
aspects of American life that the Obama EPA is not planning to regulate. And
it is businesses and working families who will pay the price.

Meanwhile, President Obama also continues his administration’s

restrictions on deepwater permits in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the
Pacific and Atlantic coasts, and its constraints on development on federal
lands. He repeatedly calls for increasing taxes on oil and natural gas
producers, even though this will only serve to raise gasoline prices, destroy
oil and gas jobs, and increase our dependency on foreign oil. His
administration is also actively promoting the federal regulation of hydraulic
fracturing, the primary method of extracting natural gas, even though states
are efficiently and effectively regulating the practice, and there have been no
confirmed cases of water contamination since the first use of hydraulic
fracturing in my home state of Oklahoma in 1949. Well, we have seen the
results of Washington’s regulation on federal lands: it leads to less
development, fewer jobs, and less economic growth. America has outpaced
Russia to become the largest producer of natural gas because our immense
shale deposits are located predominantly in areas of the country where states
primarily regulate oil and gas development, not the federal government. In
states like Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, West
Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, and North Dakota, a boom in natural gas and oil
development is transforming America’s energy outlook—all thanks to the
absence of federal red tape. Putting the federal government in charge of
fracking will severely limit our ability to develop these vast resources.

President Obama has plenty of allies in this war on affordable energy who

are working overtime to restrict our domestic energy supply. This “green
team” includes the new Secretary of Commerce, John Bryson, who once
called the Waxman-Markey cap and trade, a “moderate but acceptable bill”19
; and his pick for Assistant Secretary for Fish Wildlife and Parks at the
Department of the Interior, Rebecca Wodder. She is a staunch opponent of
hydraulic fracturing, which she has said “has a nasty track record of creating
a toxic chemical soup that pollutes groundwater and streams.”20 Also on the
President’s green team is his selection for chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, Alan Krueger, who has made it clear that “the
administration believes that it is no longer sufficient to address our nation’s
energy needs by finding more fossil fuels.”21 Perhaps the most telling
comment in this war on affordable energy comes from Secretary of Energy
Steven Chu, who told the Wall Street Journal in 2008, “Somehow we have

to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.”
That’s interesting. Just what are those “levels” in Europe?22

• The United Kingdom: $7.87 per gallon

• Italy: $7.54 per gallon

• France: $7.50 per gallon

• Germany: $7.41 per gallon

So if you think paying over $4.00 is too much for a gallon of regular,

fasten your seat belts. The Obama Administration is here to make it happen.

Meanwhile, Gore is still drowning in a sea of his own global warming

illusions, desperately trying to keep alarmism alive. On September 15, 2011,
Gore launched another global warming awareness event—a twenty-four-hour
Climate Reality Project that was featured in several cities around the world
and streamed live on the internet. But on that same day, in the midst of his
latest campaign, Gore was dealt an inconvenient truth when the Obama
Administration said that it would have to delay action on the EPA’s
greenhouse gas regulations, which were supposed to be announced
September 30, 2011.23

The reason for this delay was obvious: not only would greenhouse gas
regulations by the EPA cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs, they
may cost President Obama his own job, and he knows that all too well.
That’s why he is punting on a number of EPA’s rules until after the 2012
elections.

The reversal of the global warming campaign since the days when Al

Gore and the IPCC both received a Nobel Peace Prize has been remarkable.
In 2007, when the IPCC released its so-called “smoking gun” report, which
claimed that the link between humans and catastrophic global warming was
“unequivocal,” it was met with a blaze of attention. On November 18, 2011,
when the now discredited IPCC released the Summary for Policymakers for
its latest global warming report, very few people even noticed. In fact, I was
one of the only senators who weighed in on the report, as many of my
colleagues were not even aware that it had been published.24

As for Al Gore, a September 2011 Rasmussen poll reported that “Despite
winning a Nobel Prize and an Oscar for his work in the global warming area,
most voters don’t consider former Vice President Al Gore an expert on the
subject.”25 Steven Hayward put it well in a March 15, 2010, article in
Weekly Standard called, “In Denial: The meltdown of the climate campaign,”
when he said that Al Gore’s New York Times op-ed was “the rhetorical
equivalent of stamping his feet and saying, “‘It is too so!’ In a sign of how
dramatic the reversal of fortune has been for the Climate Campaign, it is now
James Inhofe, the leading climate skeptic in the Senate, who is eager to have
Gore testify before Congress.”26

In 2003, I stood alone in saying that the science behind anthropogenic

catastrophic global warming was a hoax and that the so-called “solutions”
were only symbolic and would have no impact on the climate. Now Gore
stands alone in his dismissal of reform, openness, transparency, and peer-
review to ensure good science, as well as his determination that man-made
catastrophic global warming is a serious threat.

But you don’t need to feel too sorry for Al Gore. Just as cap and trade

was about to collapse, the New York Times reported on November 2, 2009,
“Critics say Mr. Gore is poised to become the world’s first ‘carbon
billionaire,’ profiteering from government policies he supports that would
direct billions of dollars to the business ventures he has invested in.”27

Even without cap and trade, Gore had serious money-making potential
from green government policies. As Stephen Spruiell put it in a March 22,
2010, article for the National Review, “Climate Profiteers: For Gore & Co.,
Green Is Gold”:

Only a small part of Gore’s investment portfolio is tied to cap and trade.
Most of the companies in which he invests would benefit from the other
parts of the Democrats’ energy bill—the parts that would be much easier
for Congress to pass. Congress has been subsidizing green programs for
decades, and that support increased dramatically with the 2005 energy
bill. But the Democrats want to pump it up still more, even though the
consensus for dramatic action on climate change is buckling like a
shoddy roof in a blizzard of scientific scandals. The U.S. government,
facing record-setting deficits and debt, cannot afford new subsidies. Yet
with “green jobs” as their rallying cry, Gore and other advocates for

more green-tech largesse will push to pick the taxpayers’ pockets—lining
their own all the while.28
Since then, Gore hasn’t fared too badly. The New York Times article

continues, “He has invested a significant portion of the tens of millions of
dollars he has earned since leaving government in 2001 in a broad array of
environmentally friendly energy and technology business ventures, like
carbon trading markets, solar cells, and waterless urinals. He has also given
away millions more to finance the nonprofit he founded, the Alliance for
Climate Protection, and another group called the Climate Project, which
trains people to present the slide show that was the basis of his documentary
An Inconvenient Truth. Royalties from his book on climate change, Our
Choice, printed on 100 percent recycled paper, will go to the Alliance, an
aide said.”29

Then there are his speaking fees—and he has been paid more than

$100,000 for a single speech. “Mr. Gore’s spokeswoman would not give a
figure for his current net worth, but the scale of his wealth is evident in a
single investment of $35 million in Capricorn Investment Group.”30 So he
will be all right.

Don’t feel too sorry for Al Gore. A billion dollars is a lot of comfort.
This book tells the story of my journey to halt the radical global warming
agenda, which, at one time—when President Obama was elected and Gore
was on top of the world—seemed inevitable. It began in 2003, when I was a

one-man truth squad and culminated with my vindication when cap and trade
was ultimately rejected, despite overwhelming Democrat majorities in both
the House and the Senate, and when the Climategate scandal revealed
allegations of cooking the science, which I had been saying all along. This
was truly one of the most important fights of my career in public service
because so much was at stake: as the leading Republican on the Environment
and Public Works Committee and the father and grandfather of twenty kids
and grandkids, I wasn’t going to sit back and allow the largest tax increase
on the American people to be imposed, all for nothing.

Despite what has been achieved, my story won’t end at the conclusion of

this book, much to the chagrin of my environmental friends, I’m sure. The
Obama Administration will continue to pursue its war on affordable energy
and, even if Obama is not reelected, global warming alarmists will continue
fighting to implement their economically damaging agenda— and they have
almost inexhaustible amounts of money and resources to advance it.
MoveOn.org, George Soros, Michael Moore, and the Hollywood elite will
still be going strong. But we will continue fighting back, and I believe the
next chapter that continues after this book ends will offer many successes,
too. In fact, we are already well on our way.

1

WHY I FIGHT

ONE OF MY GRANDKIDS ASKED me one day, “Pop I, why do you do things
nobody else does?”

You see, “I” is for Inhofe, so it’s “Pop I” and “Mom I,” according to our

twenty kids and grandkids.

My answer was simple, “Because nobody else does.”
When I think back on those years when I was alone standing up against the

global warming machine, I can’t imagine what would have happened if I
hadn’t…certainly nobody else would. But I knew that I couldn’t just stand by
and let our government implement policies that would leave our country so
much worse off for my twenty kids and grandkids.

Anyone who has visited me in my office knows how much my family
means to me; they rarely leave without being bombarded with multiple
pictures.

Even my readers are not exempt. For one thing, how many guys can

actually say that they married the girl next door? I did, and we have been
happily married for over fifty years, living in the same house in Tulsa that we
moved into not long after our wedding day. Kay and I feel incredibly blessed
by our four children, Jimmy, Perry, Molly, and Katy, and our twelve
wonderful grandkids. My sons-in-law and daughters-in-law round out the
twenty. Jimmy and his wife, Shannon, have three kids; Perry (a hand surgeon)
and his wife, Nancy (a pediatrician) have two kids; Katy and Brad have three
kids. They live virtually next door to Kay and me, and Molly and Jimmy with
their four kids live only an hour away. How often does that happen? It usually
doesn’t, but it did.

Global warming activists often take the high moral ground and claim that
they are on a crusade to save the planet for future generations. But what they
never acknowledge is that their policies would give our children a

substantially depressed quality of life, forcing them to live in a less free, less
prosperous America. My dream for my children and grandchildren is the
same as the dream of parents all over America: that our kids will reap the
many blessings of living in a free country and that their opportunities will be
even greater than our own. Under a global warming cap and trade regime,
this dream would have just been a fantasy.

When I was ambushed by global warming advocates recently—no, they

haven’t given up—they asked me the same questions they always ask: “What
if you’re wrong?” and “If you’re wrong will you apologize to future
generations?” I always answer, “What if you’re wrong? Will you apologize
to my twenty kids and grandkids for the largest tax increase in American
history?”31 They usually don’t have anything to say after that.

My willingness to take up the global warming fight when no one else

would comes from so many experiences in my past as a father and
grandfather, entrepreneur and public servant, that made me the guy I was to
become when I finally took up the gavel as Chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee in 2003—a position that awarded
me the best possible platform.

OVERREGULATION NATION
It all started in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a fire escape—or more accurately,
with the many ridiculous, unnecessary regulations surrounding that particular
fire escape.

At the time, I was working long, hard hours as a developer. I was making

fortunes, losing fortunes, expanding the tax base, doing the things I thought
Americans were supposed to do. And all that time, the chief opposition I had
to living out my American dream was, ironically, the government.

This was especially clear to me in the late 1970s when I purchased the
Wrightsman Oil Estate, which had been abandoned for many years and had
since fallen to ruin. In fact, it had become the favorite shelter for derelicts
who were breaking in and burning the furniture to keep warm. But the house
was extraordinary and it had a long, rich history. During World War II, the
wealthy owners donated the mansion to the war effort, allowing the aviation
community to live there while building the Douglas aircraft. Anyone who
knows my love of flying would understand why I found its story so
compelling. I saw a wonderful opportunity to restore the home to its former

glory and couldn’t wait to get started. I hired the construction crew
immediately to expedite the renovation.

The only eyesore to the otherwise beautiful estate was one particularly
ugly fire escape that was in plain sight. But I thought, no problem, I’ll just
move it to the north side of the building where it will still serve its purpose
but not be visible from the street.

I was told that in order to do so, I would have to get the City Engineer’s
permission. So I promptly appeared at the City Engineer’s office, made my
request, and within moments I was flat-out rejected. “But I’m not changing
anything to the structure or the foundation,” I said, bewildered. “It won’t
create any safety concerns whatsoever. I’m simply moving the fire escape
from the south side to the north side of the building. It still serves exactly the
same purpose; it’s just in a different location.” But the Engineer was not
moved. He told me I would have to take my request to the city board, put my
name on the agenda, and they would hear my case in about two months.
“Two months?” I exclaimed, “This project can’t be delayed that long

because all the workers are being paid now. That will cost me thousands of
dollars. Are you telling me you won’t help me at all?”

He just looked at me and said, “That’s your problem, not mine.”
So I told him that I was going to run for Mayor and fire him. And I ran for

Mayor and I fired him.

When I became Mayor of the City of Tulsa in 1978, I set out to make sure
the size of the government, both in the operating budget and the numbers of
employees, did not grow. I remember just after taking office a man came up
to me and said, “Congratulations, Mayor on your victory. When would you
like to have the Inhofe Hour, monthly, weekly, or daily?” When I inquired as
to what the Inhofe Hour was, he said, “Well, we will let you go on our cable
station to explain to the people your policies and programs.” I responded,
“You mean so that I can use the public funds to propagandize the electorate?”

The guy agreed that was a pretty good analysis, so I told him, “I don’t

want the Inhofe Hour monthly, weekly, or daily. As a matter of fact, I’m going
to defund you.” In the weeks after that, I found that they were running a script
along the bottom of the screen of this cable station that no one watched,
saying, “Your Mayor is trying to close the doors of government. Call the
Mayor’s office immediately and say that you demand to have this channel.”
We succeeded in defunding the agency and no one seemed to miss it.

Now that doesn’t sound like a big deal, but it is. Most people just roll

over when they are abused by big government. And bureaucrats seem to have
unlimited resources—our tax dollars—to come after us. I hope you stick with
this book to read a later chapter, the “Afterword.” It will give you insight
into the source of the power of the bureaucracy…(hint: bureaucratic
earmarks.) And no one can appreciate the abusive government power until he
has been through it. I’ve been there.

I never forgot how in my daily work as a developer I was bombarded

with regulations from the city, state, and federal government, so much so that
I once had to go to twenty-six different government bureaucracies in order to
get a dock permit for a single condo project.

Having gone through that, I could understand why so many people just

throw in the towel and close their businesses altogether. Unfortunately, this is
exactly what happened to one of the best men I have ever known, my mentor
A.W. Swift. When I was young I used to work with A.W. on his oil rigs, and
he taught me so much about energy development and how to run a successful
business. That was back in the days when you drilled for oil with cable tools
as opposed to rotary bits. It worked on the principle of pounding. The bit
would be raised up and dropped deepening the hole a few inches each time,
until you struck oil—or didn’t. It was backbreaking work, but I loved it and
often worked two eight hour shifts without stopping.

A.W. had one son, Bert, who had become an engineer and the three of us
worked together. One night, there was a terrible tragedy on the rig: the well
that Bert and I were working on exploded and he was fatally burned. After
Bert’s death, I became like a son to A.W. I often thought of following in his
footsteps and still wonder to this day what would have happened if I had
made the oil business my career. But, of course, I took a different path.
About twenty years later, when I drove up to visit him at his home

overlooking Keystone Lake, I was shocked to see all of his cable tool rigs
stacked and sitting idle in his front yard. He told me sadly that he had given
up the drilling business. When I asked why, he said, “It’s because I can’t
handle the government regulations any longer. Here I am out working hard,
trying to produce cheap oil for Oklahomans and the government keeps
imposing regulations until they have just flat driven me out of business.”

A.W. Swift was the epitome of the hard working, frontier spirited

American. He was involved in an honorable profession, worked harder than

most, was very religious, and provided jobs for as many as twenty-five or so
people. Yet he was regulated out of business by the pseudo-intellectuals in
Washington who think they know best. I remember thinking at the time how
ironic it was that the very government that was supposed to create an
environment where A.W. could achieve his American dream was the very
institution that had managed to quell it. Something had to change.

“LONE VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS” ONE-MAN TRUTH SQUAD:
THE EARLY YEARS
Many think that my reputation for being a “one-man truth squad” on Capitol
Hill started with the global warming debate, but actually, it started much
earlier than that.

I remember back when I was first elected to Congress. The total national
debt was $200 billion and I was outraged. I recall an ad on television that
was produced by some national taxpayers group on what $200 billion was.
They stacked up $1 bills in this 30 second spot until it reached the height of
the Empire State Building, and that was $200 billion. Back then, I was a
young, energized zealot who was going to do something about all of this.
Come to think about it, I did do something about it.

When I was first in the Oklahoma Senate in 1968, then-Senator Carl

Curtis, a Republican from Nebraska, asked me if I’d help him convince states
to ratify a balanced budget amendment so that Congress would be forced to
face up to the issue. Senator Curtis told me that when he annually introduced
a budget balancing amendment to the Constitution, that the excuse used by his
fellow senators for not voting for it, was that 3/4 of the states will never
ratify it. So he charged me with the job of leading 3/4 of the states to “pre-
ratify” the budget balancing amendment. I introduced and passed the first
resolution by any state to join an initiative calling for a constitutional
convention for the purpose of adopting a budget balancing amendment to the
Constitution. We got to just one short of the 3/4 of the states necessary to pass
resolutions calling for this constitutional convention. Then one of the national
conservative groups decided that there was too much of a risk in calling for a
convention, so the conservatives became split and the effort failed.

In a column called “A Voice in the Wilderness,” Anthony Harrigan wrote,

“Way out in Oklahoma there is a state senator who is going to balance the

federal budget.”32 I’ve felt like that voice in the wilderness many times since
then.

As a state legislator and as a mayor, there was only so much I could do to

rein in the excessive regulations and out-of-control spending that were
hurting our economy. The greatest overregulator of all was clearly the federal
government, so I knew that if I wanted to be part of the solution, I had to go to
Washington.

When I arrived in D.C. in 1987 as the Congressman from Oklahoma’s
First District, what surprised me the most was that so many of my liberal
colleagues in the House, who were constantly pushing for more and more
job-killing regulations, had never held a “real job” in their entire lives. Then
I discovered that many members never go home. Why should they? There
seem to be more golf courses in Northern Virginia than anywhere else. So I
started the Tuesday—Thursday Club and went back and worked my district
every weekend. Here’s what happens: members who stay in Washington
become part of the problem. You live next door to a lobbyist, a member, or a
staffer. You see, there aren’t any normal people in Washington and you forget
what real people are like. Most of these guys don’t understand the extent to
which overreaching regulations are hurting businesses and job growth.

Much of that comes from the attitude of many on the liberal left that they
know what’s best for everyone else—an attitude that reached new heights
during the global warming debate. D.C. politicians were working overtime to
hide the real costs of their global warming cap and trade regulations because
they knew the American people would never go for it. But as far as they were
concerned, it was none of their business. They were going to save the world
from global warming catastrophe whether their constituents liked it or not.
They just didn’t want voters to realize that this would mean the largest tax
increase in American history, higher energy costs, hundreds of thousands of
lost jobs, a depressed economy, and a much less free country.

I discovered that not only did my liberal colleagues in the House believe
it was none of their constituents’ business how they voted, but that there were
set procedures in place to make sure of that.

There was one particular statement that I often heard whispered in the

Cloakroom: “Vote liberal and press release conservative.” Never once did I
hear, “Vote conservative and press release liberal.” I discovered that in
1932, a very powerful Democrat from Texas, Speaker John Nance Garner,

had set up a system that would allow Democrats from conservative districts
to do just that: vote for liberal causes, while pretending to be conservatives.

This is the way it worked: When a bill is introduced, it is assigned to a

committee in the House of Representatives. In order for it to come to the
Floor for a vote, there would have to be a committee hearing and a public
vote. However, there was another more obscure method to bring it to the
Floor for a vote, and that was for a majority of the Members of the House
(218) to sign a Discharge Petition that was located in a drawer at the
Speaker’s desk. No member of the press or public could view the Discharge
Petition, and no Member of Congress was allowed to have a list of the other
Members who had signed a Discharge Petition. Of course, when you went to
sign, you could see the other ten names on the page with you, but you were
not allowed to write those names down. If any Member disclosed the names
of anyone who had signed the Discharge Petition, the penalty was that the
person could be expelled from House of Representatives.

This system seemed outrageous to me, and it was even more upsetting that
no one had ever fought it. But it occurred to me that something could be done:
I introduced a Resolution that would make the signatures of a Discharge
Petition a matter of public record. Of course, the Speaker and the Democratic
leadership didn’t like that one bit, so they assigned my resolution to a
committee that agreed never to bring it up for a vote. After that, the only way
to get it out for a vote was to file a Discharge Petition on the Discharge
Petition and have that placed in the Speaker’s drawer. I knew that this would
be very heavy lifting for just one Congressman, but I was determined.

Unfortunately, my Discharge Petition suffered the fate of the process I was
trying to reform. So the only way I could get what I wanted was to expose the
names of those Members who signed my Discharge Petition. Of course, most
Members claimed that they had done so as to appear as though they cared
about transparency in government, knowing full well that they would never
be caught. But I had a plan: I found a few Republican House Members who
were willing to take the risk with me to memorize one page of signatures
while they signed themselves, and report those names back to me. I compiled
the list of names, gave it to the Wall Street Journal, and let the chips fall
where they may.

Of course, no Democrats had signed. I spent the rest of August recess on

radio shows in each of the Democratic districts explaining my Discharge

Petition, and I was pleased that there was such a groundswell of support
from across America. The way the system worked is that once the 218th
member signed, the signatures stopped. By the end of that August recess, the
remaining Democratic members, under pressure from their constituents, were
begging me to include their names, since they could not be added after the
218th name.

For sixty years, no one had dared to challenge this rule; even if they had
wanted to, many were intimidated by the threat that they could be expelled.
During that time, I was asked if I was worried about being thrown out of the
House of Representatives. I replied that I would simply run in my own
special election to replace me and then fill my own vacancy. Besides, there
was no way the Democrats could expel me after that.

I was proud to learn later that this became known as one of the most

significant reforms in the history of the House of Representatives and I was
happy that my efforts were appreciated. As the Daily Oklahoman, wrote,
“Inhofe’s victory… is one of the most significant changes in congressional
rules in the modern era.”33

POISED TO TAKE THE GAVEL
When I was elected to the U.S. Senate, I knew from the start exactly what
committees I wanted to serve on: Armed Services, and Environment and
Public Works. My reason for wanting to be on Armed Services was simple. I
am proud to have served in the U.S. Army. It was probably the best thing that
could have happened to me, as I developed a profound appreciation for the
price of freedom.

When I was elected to the Oklahoma Legislature in 1967, one of my first

duties was to travel to Washington to appear before the Environment and
Public Works Committee, when Senator Jennings Randolph was the
Chairman, to protest Ladybird’s Highway Beautification Act of 1965. Little
did I know then that this would be the Committee I would ultimately end up
chairing.

Since my goal was to do whatever I could to rein in the kinds of

regulations that stifle entrepreneurship and job growth, I felt it was important
to serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee. This committee
has primary jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection Agency—an
agency that puts forth some of the most job-destroying regulations in the

country. From water rules, to the regulation of our energy capabilities, the
EPA has the power to affect almost every facet of business and industry in
America, and under the Obama administration, the results have been
devastating for our economy.

These overreaching regulations especially have huge impacts on my state
of Oklahoma, which is one of the top energy producing states in the country.
I’m a pilot and I often fly my plane around the state to different political and
civic events. When I fly into Will Rogers Airport in Oklahoma City and look
out the window, I’m always greeted by multiple pump jacks located just off
the runways, and there are more still pumping alongside the highways as you
travel through the state. It’s second nature to see that in Oklahoma—we’re
known for our energy development, so much so that old “Petunia #1,” an oil
well named for being in the middle of a flower bed, stands tall in front of the
Oklahoma State Capitol building. It no longer produces oil, but it’s a
reminder of past and present Oklahoma.

Oklahoma has been blessed with tremendous resources, and developing
those resources has led to a huge economic boost and the creation of good
paying jobs.34 In fact, Oklahoma’s unemployment rate is a far cry from the
national unemployment rate. This good state economy is in large part due to
our strong energy development industry. The U.S. Energy Information
Administration reports that presently Oklahoma has over 83,000 producing
oil wells and well over 43,000 producing natural gas wells.35 Oklahoma
City University published a study in 2009, which found that the oil and gas
industry in Oklahoma is responsible for 300,000 jobs in the state and
contributes $51 billion to the state economy in just one year alone. In fact,
twenty-percent of state revenues are due to the oil and gas industry.36 In
addition to oil and gas, Oklahoma is also one of the largest wind energy-
generating states. I have always said that the best way to power this machine
called America is through an all-of-the above energy policy that includes
fossil fuels and renewables—and Oklahoma provides a good example of
that.

Far from being a friend of Big Oil, as the accusation is often levied

against me, I am a friend of “Little Oil” or of any Oklahomans who strive to
develop our vast resources. Most of those involved in energy development in
Oklahoma are running small businesses, like A.W. Swift. They are the people
I fight for every day in Washington.

Many environmentalists see me as their enemy because they measure the

“greenness” of politicians by how many federal laws they impose on the
American people. In contrast, I have always believed that the environment is
best served when the economy is strong, and we can develop our resources
while being good stewards of the environment.

On August 3, 2007, Emily Belz of The Hill contacted me to ask if I

consider myself a green lawmaker.37 I said absolutely: I have always strived
to be a good steward of the environment and I see myself as a
conservationist. One of my favorite stories involves Ila Loetscher, a
remarkable person who is known to most as the “Turtle Lady.” I met Ila over
forty years ago while spending time on South Padre Island with my family.
She used to rescue turtles from nets and traps—some of them had torn
flippers and cracked shells. She trained her turtles to clap their flippers and
roll over in the water on cue. Our kids loved to watch them perform. The
Ridley Sea Turtles lay their eggs, cover them, and leave. When the eggs
hatch, the tiny turtles must struggle on their own toward the water, and those
who make it, swim away. It wasn’t long before Ila had all of us out on the
beaches of South Padre late at night guarding and protecting newly hatched
Ridley Sea Turtles as they made their first journey from the beach to the
ocean.

As part of being a conservationist, I have always believed that personal
responsibility breeds environmental stewardship. I saw this so often when I
was Mayor of Tulsa: whenever individuals were involved in efforts to
protect the species and the environment, the outcome is always more
effective and efficient than it would be with regulations solely from the
federal government. One of the best examples of this is the Partners for Fish
and Wildlife Program, which was authorized when I was Chairman of the
Environment and Public Works Committee. Whereas regulations under the
Endangered Species Act have a low success rate in recovering species but
are highly successful in stifling economic growth, the Partners Program is
much more effective in preserving the species and the economy because it
works with property owners instead of against them.

Good energy and environment policy is about achieving a healthy balance
between environmental progress and economic growth. The global warming
regulations promoted by President Obama, whether through cap and trade or
through regulations by the EPA, completely lack that balance, so much so that

they would destroy our economy while doing nothing to help the
environment. Looking back, it is clear that the global warming debate was
never really about saving the world; it was about controlling the lives of
every American. MIT climate scientist Richard Lindzen summed up it up
perfectly in March 2007 when he said, “Controlling carbon is a bureaucrat’s
dream. If you control carbon, you control life.”38

Having every aspect of one’s life controlled is completely against

everything America stands for, and that’s why global warming is one of the
defining debates of our era. These experiences in my life, from reining in
job-killing regulations as Mayor of Tulsa, to being the voice in the
wilderness on the balanced budget amendment, to my one-man truth squad
battle in the House, even to rescuing turtles in South Padre island are the
training grounds that prepared me to fight this huge battle: The Greatest
Hoax.

2

“THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN ON THE

PLANET”: EXPOSING THE HOAX

WHEN I ARRIVED IN MILAN, Italy, in December 2003 for the annual IPCC
global warming conference, I was in for a big surprise. While I was fully
aware that I would be walking straight into the lion’s den, I certainly wasn’t
expecting to find my face on a WANTED poster for being “The most
dangerous man on the planet.” My crime was clearly laid out; under a picture
of me at the dais was the quote that had made me famous with the
environmental crowd just a few months before: “Global warming is the
greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.”

I looked around and realized that the posters were plastered everywhere

throughout the convention center, and there were some taped to telephone
poles on the city streets. When I first discovered that I was the most
dangerous man on the planet, I must admit, I was a little stunned. But then I
thought of how my family and friends would smile when they heard the news
and I knew my grandchildren would be impressed. Up until that point, the
closest I had ever come to being called “dangerous” was when I was
repeatedly referred to as the “Renegade Conservative from Oklahoma”—a
title I have long been proud to have. Now because I had dared to question the
validity of the radical global warming agenda, I was suddenly the world’s
most wanted climate criminal. With so much wrath directed at me, my
colleagues even suggested that I may be a target in Italy and perhaps I should
request that the conference provide me with additional security.

But if they were trying to intimidate me, it didn’t work. My staff tried to

stop me as I made my way over the room of the National Environmental
Trust, the group responsible for the incriminating posters. When they saw me
coming they looked worried—they thought I was going to be mad, but instead

I smiled and shook their hands. I told them, “I’m just glad you guys got my
quote right this time. You know, you usually misquote me.”

The young man behind the table asked me to autograph one of the posters

and I said I’d be honored. “Great to have friends like you, Jim Inhofe,” I
wrote. It turns out that my autographed poster hung framed in their
Washington, D.C., office for years. It may still be there.

TAKING UP THE GAVEL
The WANTED posters incident was a critical juncture when I came to
understand firsthand just how far the environmental left will go to isolate and
silence anyone who dares to call their agenda into question. Instead of
engaging in an intellectual debate about the problems I had exposed in the
scientific process underlying their theories, they resorted to threats and
attacks. And that is precisely why they ultimately lost the debate. I’ve always
said that when you don’t have science on your side, when you don’t have
logic on your side, when you don’t have truth on your side, you resort to
attacks.

For a long time, it worked: once intimidated, many of my colleagues

would either change their position on global warming, or they would stay
quiet so as not to be a target. In fact, the green movement had a clear record
of success in silencing dissenters—that is, until I became Chairman of the
Environment and Public Works Committee in 2003. Not only did I
consistently speak out myself, I made it a priority to ensure that other
silenced voices, especially in the scientific community, were heard as well.
From the moment the new committee leadership was in place, I think the

Environment and Public Works Committee didn’t know what hit them. I could
not have been more different from my predecessors. In fact, as a staunch
conservative from Oklahoma, an energy-developing state, I was a radical
departure from my colleagues who had held my position before, including
Senators Jim Jeffords of Vermont, Robert Smith of New Hampshire, and John
Chafee of Rhode Island, who were, for the most part, less conservative and
from eastern states with much different constituencies. More often than not,
they believed that the more regulations from Washington, the better for our
environment and nation. I never saw it that way; I have always believed that
we need to achieve a healthy balance between environmental progress and
economic growth. In fact, I was the first Chairman to invite witnesses from

industry and energy development sectors to testify on how excessive
environmental regulations may affect their ability to create jobs or expand
their businesses. Also for the first recorded time in the Committee’s history, I
made sure that it was staffed with people who had actually worked for a
living, instead of filling it with the kinds of idealists who often end up in
these jobs.

Because the Environment and Public Works Committee has primary

jurisdiction over the issue of global warming, I realized that as Chairman, I
had a profound responsibility, as any “solution” to global warming would
have far-reaching impacts for our nation. That’s why from the moment I took
up the gavel, I established three key principles for our work on the
committee: (1) it should rely on the most objective science, (2) it should
consider costs on businesses and consumers, and (3) the bureaucracy should
serve, not rule, the people. I knew that without these principles, we could not
make effective public policy decisions. These three principles would guide
us as we continued to improve the environment, while also encouraging
economic growth and prosperity. It was a fundamental shift in the way the
Committee operated. For the first time in environmental policy, instead of
looking at a problem with the mindset of “How can the federal government
solve the problem?” we looked at “What problems were the federal
government causing?”

KYOTO TREATY ALL ECONOMIC PAIN FOR NO
ENVIRONMENTAL GAIN
In the 1990s, as the global warming hysteria was heating up, the so-called
solution was the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that required nations that were
signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by considerable
amounts below 1990 levels; specifically, the U.S. would have to reduce its
emissions 31 percent below the level otherwise predicted for 2010. To put
this in perspective, as the Business Roundtable pointed out, that target was
“the equivalent of having to eliminate all current emissions from either the
U.S. transportation sector, or the utilities sector [residential and commercial
sources], or industry.”39

The Clinton Administration, led by then Vice President Al Gore, signed

Kyoto on November 12, 1998, but never submitted it to the Senate for
ratification. That’s because the Senate sent a powerful message to President

Clinton. By a vote of 95-0, the Senate passed the Byrd-Hagel resolution on
July 25, 1997, which stated that the Senate would not ratify a treaty if (1) it
caused substantial economic harm and (2) if developing countries were not
required to participate on the same timetable.40

Of course, Kyoto satisfied neither of the requirements of the Byrd-Hagel

resolution. One definitive study from Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates, or WEFA, a private consulting company founded by professors
from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School, revealed
that Kyoto would cost 2.4 million U.S. jobs and reduce GDP by 3.2
percent.41 In other words, the pricetag for the United States would be over
$300 billion annually. It found that Americans would face higher food,
medical, and housing costs—for food, an increase of 9 percent; medicine, an
increase of 11 percent; and housing, an increase of 21 percent. At the same
time, an average household of four would see its real income drop by $2,700
in 2010, and each year thereafter. Under Kyoto, energy and electricity prices
would nearly double, and gasoline prices would go up an additional 65 cents
per gallon. It was truly a recipe for economic disaster.

In July 2003, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that “The
price increases resulting from a carbon cap would be regressive— that is,
they would place a relatively greater burden on lower-income households
than on higher-income ones.”42 So it would have been a raw deal for
America and a disaster for the poor, who would have to pay a
disproportionate amount of their incomes on higher energy prices. I have
always found it ironic that the environmental left continually claims the high
moral ground, saying that their policies are to protect the most vulnerable, yet
the very policies they espouse would cause the greatest harm to the poorest
among us.

One witness we called before the Committee, Tom Mullen of the

Cleveland Catholic Charities, put it the most succinctly:

The elderly on fixed limited incomes and the working poor with families
have made it clear to me on a daily basis that they cannot afford increases
in costs for their basic needs. In Cleveland, over one-fourth of all
children live in poverty and are in a family of a single female head of
household. These children will suffer further loss of basic needs as their
moms are forced to make choices of whether to pay the rent or live in a

shelter; pay the heating bill or see their child freeze; buy food or risk the
availability of a hunger center. These are not choices any senior citizen,
child, or, for that matter, person in America should make.43

In 2003, those Americans who made less than $30,000 spent 22 percent of
their take-home pay on energy costs, such as gasoline or their monthly utility
bills. People who made less than $10,000 per year spent 68 percent of their
take-home pay on energy. Many of those people live in my home state of
Oklahoma and other rural and urban areas of the country that the East and
West coast liberal elites refer to as flyover country.

One would think that for all the economic suffering that the United States
would have to endure, surely it would be worth it; surely it would save the
world. Not exactly. The Kyoto Treaty did not bind developing countries like
China, India, Brazil, and Mexico, who were all signatories to Kyoto and
some of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to any emission
requirements. It’s not difficult to predict the results: as jobs went overseas
and to countries that do not have emissions limits, worldwide emissions
would actually increase.

In the end, no matter how the environmental left tried to couch it; no matter

what the politicians said to make their case, Kyoto would have been all
economic pain for no environmental gain. Sometimes I feel like a broken
record, as I have been repeating that message ever since I began this fight. In
2003, I told world leaders in Milan that the U.S. would never ratify Kyoto.
Six years later, in Copenhagen in 2009, I told world leaders that the United
States Senate would never pass cap and trade. They didn’t like my message
then and they don’t like it now. But I was right and they were wrong.

KYOTO: NOT ABOUT SAVING THE PLANET
In truth, Kyoto’s objective had nothing to do with saving the globe, because it
was clear that was the one thing it would fail to do—it was purely political.
Before and during the time I was Chairman, the push for the United States

to ratify Kyoto continued. In June 2001, Germany released a statement
declaring that the world needs Kyoto because its greenhouse gas reduction
targets “are indispensable.”44 Also that June, Swedish Prime Minister
Goeran Persson flatly stated that Kyoto is necessary.45 I couldn’t help but
ask: necessary for what? We already knew that it would not reduce

emissions. In fact, at that time, according to the EU, Environment Ministry,
most EU member states were not on schedule to meet their Kyoto targets.

Even from the beginning it was very clear that Kyoto was not about

reducing emissions, but something much more sinister. One indication of this
came from Russia, who ratified Kyoto not because the government believed
in catastrophic global warming, but because ratification was Russia’s key to
joining the World Trade Organization. Also, under Kyoto, Russia could profit
from selling emissions credits to the EU and continue business as usual,
without undertaking economically harmful emissions reductions. They could
make billions of dollars by not developing their own natural resources.

This made a big impression on me because I had the opportunity to fly an
airplane around the world. In fact, I’m one of the relatively few private-plane
pilots who has followed in the tradition of Oklahoman Wiley Post, who
traveled around the world in a small private plane in 1931. There’s an
amazing thing about flying in a small aircraft. You see the world from a
different vantage point—closer to the ground than the major airliners but high
enough to get a distinct perspective on the ground below, the sky above, and
the horizon in the distance. I remember taking off from Moscow and flying
over the vast wilderness of Siberia where they have all these natural
resources. I was flying over time zone after time zone without seeing any sign
of life—nothing but one east-west river that runs through there. All that time I
was thinking, these engines are running pretty rough and its lousy gasoline
they’ve got over here. What will I do if I end up down there? Just being up
there and seeing for myself the vast land that contained a wealth of resources
that would remain untapped—it seemed like such a waste.

But that’s the way the system works: countries are rewarded for not
developing their resources. While in Milan, I met with members of the
Russian delegation, who told me, “of course we will sign the Kyoto Treaty,
we don’t believe in global warming, but we get so much funding from the UN
and developed countries that we would be foolish not to sign. Also, the
Treaty will be long dead before Russia would have to comply.”

It was clear that the point of Kyoto wasn’t to reduce emissions, so what

was it? French President Jacques Chirac provided a good answer to that
question at The Hague in November 2000 when he explained that Kyoto
represents “the first component of an authentic global governance.”46 Margot
Wallstrom, the EU’s Environment Commissioner, took a slightly different

view, but one that reveals the real motives of Kyoto’s supporters. She
asserted that Kyoto is about “the economy, about leveling the playing field
for big businesses worldwide.”47 The meaning behind Chirac and
Wallstrom’s comments was clear to me: (1) Kyoto represented an attempt by
certain elements within the international community to restrain U.S. interests;
and (2) Kyoto was an economic weapon designed to undermine the global
competitiveness and economic superiority of the United States. Canadian
Prime Minister Stephen Harper put it well when he later called Kyoto a
“socialist scheme.”48 In short, Kyoto went against everything the United
States stands for.

THE GREATEST HOAX
When I became Chairman, I said that if the United States was even going to
consider taking drastic measures on global warming, the science behind
those decisions had better be absolutely sound.

I am most remembered for standing on the Senate floor in July 2003 and
declaring that man-made catastrophic global warming is the greatest hoax
ever perpetrated on the American people. I am often accused of coming to
that conclusion flippantly—as many on the environmental left have said, just
because I didn’t like what I heard from the mainstream global warming
alarmists. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I came to that conclusion
only after engaging in a lengthy, rigorous oversight process over the course of
a few years; it was the most thorough investigation of the science by any
senator. In more than twelve thousand words and several hours on the floor
over the course of two days, I brought numerous inconsistencies and gaps in
the mainstream theory to light. Only after that did I conclude that the science
to justify the catastrophic theory simply was not there.

My painstaking oversight was almost to a fault, so much so that one

editorial in the Oklahoman, looking back on a number of my science
speeches, said that my “detailed and highly technical fodder” might “have a
dual use as a cure for insomnia.” Although I may have been putting everyone
to sleep with my exhaustive approach, I was also appreciative that the
editorial recognized the importance of my work. As it also said, “Credit
Inhofe for nimbly making his case. And we think he’s got a point. The science
on human causation of global warming is conflicted and unsettled. There’s

something to be said for a senator who does his homework and is willing to
swim against the stream on this important issue.”49

My “Greatest Hoax” speech was the first speech I gave on the Senate
floor as Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I
knew that it was going to be a defining moment for me going forward in this
leadership role. The night before I gave the speech, I spent hours going
through it with one of my most trusted aides. At the end of our meeting, I told
him how I wanted to close: with my famous line. I took out a pen and
handwrote it at the conclusion of the speech, “With all of the hysteria, all of
the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming
is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? It sure sounds
like it.”

He looked slightly pained and asked seriously, “Are you sure?” He asked

me that question not because there was any doubt that it was the message I
needed to convey. He was asking me if I was prepared to endure the wrath of
the environmental left for that comment, for the most part all alone—which
clearly manifested itself months later in Milan. He tried to talk me out of it
but at that moment, I couldn’t have been more sure; catastrophic global
warming was the greatest hoax, and it was my responsibility to expose it for
what it was. The next day I asked him, “Now you made sure to put that line in
the speech, right?”

Hopefully without offering my readers a cure for insomnia, it is important

to explain how I came to that conclusion.

CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING BASED ON FEAR, NOT
SCIENCE
I am a U.S. Senator, and a former mayor and businessman. I am not a
scientist. But I do understand politics. And the more I delved into the science
purporting global catastrophe, the more I saw the extent to which the science
was being co-opted by those who care more about peddling fear of gloom
and doom to further their own, broader political agendas.

As I said on the Senate floor in July 2003, much of the debate about global
warming is predicated on fear rather than science. The alarmists predicted a
future plagued by catastrophic flooding, war, terrorism, economic
dislocations, droughts, crop failures, mosquito-borne diseases, and harsh

weather, and they placed the blamed squarely on man-made carbon
emissions.

One thing that people don’t always realize is that global warming

alarmism became like a religion that divided the world into believers and
skeptics—the latter of which was the most exclusive club in Washington, as
it consisted primarily of me. At any rate, being a skeptic was to them heresy
of the highest order. That, of course, is what landed my face on those
WANTED posters for being the most dangerous man on the planet. I still find
it amazing that, in their minds, I was capable of singlehandedly bringing
about the end of the world. But such was their logic.

Of course, alarmists accused me of attacking the science of global

warming—that is part of their game. But the truth is that throughout my battle
against the hoax, I consistently defended credible, objective science by
exposing the corrupting influences that continually subverted it for political
purposes. Good policy must be based on good science, not on religion, and
that requires science free from bias, whatever its conclusions.

GLOBAL WARMING OR GLOBAL COOLING?
I began my investigation by delving first into some of the most obvious
inconsistencies of the catastrophe rhetoric.

My starting point was a quote from a particular Newsweek magazine

article that said, “There are ominous signs that the Earth’s weather patterns
have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a
drastic decline in food production—with serious political implications for
just about every nation on Earth.”50 Another came from Time magazine: “As
they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past several
years, a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect that many
seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are actually part of a
global climatic upheaval.”51 All of this climate rhetoric sounds very
ominous. That is, until you realize that these passages come from articles in a
1975 edition of Newsweek magazine and Time magazine in 1974. These
articles weren’t referring to global warming; they were warning of a coming
ice age.

These fears can also be found in a 1974 study by the National Science

Board, the governing body of the National Science Foundation, which stated,
“During the last 20 to 30 years, world temperature has fallen, irregularly at

first but more sharply over the last decade.”52 Two years earlier, the board
had observed: “Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the
present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end… leading into
the next glacial age.”53

Yet, not long after we went through a widespread global cooling scare,

alarmists boldly went forward to assert that the science behind the
phenomenon of global warming was “settled,” the “debate was over,” and
that there was no question that it was man-made and catastrophic.

In truth, since 1895, alarmists have alternated between global cooling and

warming scares during four separate and sometimes overlapping time
periods. From 1895 until the 1930s, the media peddled a coming ice age—
and the world was coming to an end. From the late 1920s until the 1960s,
they warned of global warming—and again the world was coming to an end.
From the 1950s until the 1970s, they warned us again of a coming ice age—
and as before, the world was coming to an end. The latest apocalyptic scare
about global warming is the fourth attempt to promote catastrophe and the
world has yet to come to an end.

While alarmists continued their message of climate apocalypse, I

maintained that it was very simplistic to say that a one degree Fahrenheit
temperature increase during the twentieth century means that we are all
doomed. After all, a one degree Fahrenheit rise has coincided with the

greatest advancement of living standards, life expectancy, food production
and human health in the history of our planet. So it is hard to argue that the
global warming we experienced in the twentieth century was somehow
negative or part of a catastrophic trend.

Of course, these particular inconsistencies in the alarmists’ theories were
the kind of observations that one could point out without delving very far into
the debate. As I continued my investigation, more and more serious
inconsistencies with the science came to light.

THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE EMERGENCE OF THE IPCC
Even though the global community has been somewhat critical of the United
States in recent years, our nation remains one of the most generous in the
world. The American people have always gone above and beyond the call of
duty to help our neighbors and far away friends who are in need.

You probably remember the aftermath of 2010’s devastating earthquake in
Haiti. According to one report published by the Inter-American Development
Bank, the disaster killed over 200,000 people and could require more than
$7 billion in recovery costs.54 How did Americans respond? With an
outpouring of generosity and support. According to the Wall Street Journal,
Americans “raised more than $150 million in four days for the Haiti relief
efforts.”55 Countless others traveled to Haiti to help with the cleanup and
rescue efforts. This is not an uncommon headline following natural disasters.
The same response occurred after the tsunamis in Japan and the Indian
Ocean. The American people are generous, and I believe that responses like
these are a natural display of our nation’s character.

This is important when considering the global warming issue because if
the American people truly believed that the effects of climate change were
man-made and going to cause the destruction of the earth, then I believe the
American people would be the first to stand up and provide a solution. But
this has not happened.

While the global warming issue did not come to the attention of the

American people until the late 1980s or early 1990s, the seeds of the hoax
were being sown decades before by environmental elites at the United
Nations.

Why would they want to do this? I believe it is because many who work at
the United Nations would like to see the institution’s mandate expanded well
beyond its original intent. I do not think they are satisfied with having an
influential role in the international arena—I think they want a controlling one.
They want the United Nations to have sovereignty, control of the world’s
economic and political systems, and the ability to tax wealthy nations and
redistribute their resources to poorer ones in an effort, as Margo Wallstrom
said, to “level the playing field.”56

Just like liberals in Washington, the elites at the United Nations truly

believe that they know how to run things better than any individual country
ever could. In this way, they are like “super-liberals” on an international
scale. On one of its websites, the UN even claims that its “moral authority” is
one of its “best properties.”57 But what do the elites and super-liberals at the
UN believe?

Briefly, their guiding philosophy is known as “sustainable development,”

and it is alarmingly similar to the utopian ideals of global socialism.
Unfortunately for us Americans, this philosophy would require those of us in
Western nations to surrender our lifestyles and our resources so that they
could be redistributed to developing nations, just as our friends from Russia
acknowledged. And who would be doing this redistribution? You got it—the
United Nations.

Perhaps what is most alarming is that this is all being done in an effort to
save the “environment,” which is why I believe the leaders at the UN have
been pushing the global warming issue so hard. In fact, the Kyoto Protocol
embodies many of the actual goals and priorities of the UN super elites. That
is why it’s a crucial component of their effort to make the UN more powerful
and important.

More details about the history of sustainable development, including how

the philosophy was developed and what is wrong with it, are included in
Appendix A. I encourage you to check that out and see all that the UN is up
to. Keep these ideas in mind as you read the rest of the book. If you do, you’ll
be able to see how the global warming issue fits in with the bigger picture of
the ambitions of the super-liberals at the UN.

But for now, let’s stay focused on the core of the story. The UN began

officially working on the global warming issue when it decided to create the
IPCC.

IPCC SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY QUESTIONED
Like most bad things that come to America, the primary science behind
catastrophic global warming came from the United Nations—specifically
from its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Again, a careful
reading of Appendix A is a must to understand thoroughly the origin of the
hoax.

The Kyoto Treaty explicitly acknowledged that man-made emissions,

primarily from fossil fuel development, are causing global temperatures to
rise to catastrophic levels. Those who sign on to Kyoto pledge to cut back
dramatically or even work to eliminate fossil fuels so that the world can
return to global temperatures at “normal” levels. According to the IPCC,
Kyoto was to achieve “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system.”58

But when it came to discovering what those “normal” levels were, the
IPCC couldn’t provide a scientific explanation. That’s because they didn’t
have one. Dr. S. Fred Singer, formerly an atmospheric scientist at the
University of Virginia, said, “No one knows what constitutes a ‘dangerous’
concentration. There exists, as yet, no scientific basis for defining such a
concentration, or even of knowing whether it is more or less than current
levels of carbon dioxide.”59 This was seriously problematic. My question
was: how can we bring greenhouse gas concentrations to normal levels if we
don’t know what those normal levels are?

The more questions I asked, the clearer it became that Kyoto emissions

reduction targets were arbitrary, lacking in scientific basis. This was not just
my opinion, but the conclusion reached by the country’s most recognized
climate scientists. Dr. Tom Wigley, one of Al Gore’s own scientists, was one
of them. After President Clinton signed on to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, Dr.
Wigley, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,
found that if the Kyoto Protocol were fully implemented by all signatories, it
would reduce temperatures by a mere 0.06 degrees Celsius by 2050.60 And
that’s if the United States had ratified Kyoto and the other signatories met
their targets. What does this mean? Such an amount is so small that ground-
based thermometers cannot reliably measure it.

Dr. Richard Lindzen, an MIT scientist and member of the National

Academy of Sciences who specializes in climate science, told the
Environment and Public Works Committee on May 2, 2001, that there is a
“definitive disconnect between Kyoto and science. Should a catastrophic
scenario prove correct, Kyoto would not prevent it.”61 Similarly, Dr. James
Hansen of NASA, the father of global warming theory citing Wigley and
Malakoff, said that Kyoto Protocol “will have little effect” on global
temperature in the twenty-first century. In a rather stunning follow-up, Hansen
said it would take thirty Kyotos to reduce warming to an acceptable level.62
If one Kyoto devastates the American economy, what would thirty do? So
even the scientists were saying that it would be all pain for no gain.

In December 2004, when several nations including the United States met

in Buenos Aires for the tenth round of international climate change
negotiations, I was happy that the U.S. delegation held firm both in its
categorical rejection of Kyoto and the questionable science behind it. Paula
Dobriansky, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, and the leader of the
U.S. delegation, put it well when she told the conference, “Science tells us
that we cannot say with any certainty what constitutes a dangerous level of
warming, and therefore what level must be avoided.”63

FLAWED IPCC ASSESSMENT REPORTS
Our rigorous oversight of the IPCC began with my “Greatest Hoax” speech in
2003 and continued over the course of many years. In numerous speeches, I
recounted the systematic and documented abuse of the scientific process by
the IPCC, which claims it provides the most complete and objective
scientific assessment in the world on the subject of climate change.

In 2003, I began to expose the flaws in the IPCC process that were

glaringly apparent in the first IPCC Assessment Report in 1990, which found
that the climate record of the past century was “broadly consistent” with the
changes in Earth’s surface temperature, as calculated by climate models that
incorporated the observed increase in greenhouse gases. This conclusion,
however, appeared suspect to me, considering the climate cooled between
1940 and 1975, just as industrial activity grew rapidly after World War II.
How does one reconcile this cooling with the observed increase in
greenhouse gases?

But the flaws revealed themselves in earnest when the IPCC issued its

second assessment report in 1996. The most obvious problem was the
altering of the document on the central question of whether man is causing
global warming. Here is what Chapter 8—the key chapter in the report—
stated on this central question in the final version accepted by reviewing
scientists: “No study to date has positively attributed all or part [of the
climate change observed] to anthropogenic causes.”64

But when the final version was published, this and similar phrases in
fifteen sections of the chapter were deleted or modified. Nearly all the
changes removed hints of scientific doubts regarding the claim that human
activities are having a major impact on global warming. In the Summary for
Policymakers—which is the only part of the report that most reporters and
policymakers read—a single phrase was inserted. It reads: “The balance of
evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global
climate.”65

The lead author for Chapter 8, Dr. Ben Santer, is not fully to blame for

manipulation of the message. According to the journal Nature, the changes to
the report were made in the midst of high-level pressure from the
Clinton/Gore State Department to do so. In fact, after the State Department
sent a letter to Sir John Houghton, Co-Chairman of the IPCC, Houghton
prevailed upon Santer to make the changes. Of course, the impact of this
change was explosive, with media across the world, including heavyweights
such as Peter Jennings, declaring this as proof that man is responsible for
global warming. On September 10, 1995, the New York Times published an
article titled “Global Warming Experts Call Human Role Likely.” According
to the Times account, the IPCC showed that global warming “is unlikely to be
entirely due to natural causes.”66 When parsed, this account means fairly
little. Not entirely due to natural causes? Well, how much, then? One
percent? Twenty percent? Eighty-five percent?

The IPCC report was replete with caveats and qualifications, providing

little evidence to support anthropogenic theories of global warming. The
preceding paragraph in which the “balance of evidence” quote appears
makes exactly that point. It reads, “Our ability to quantify the human influence
on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still
emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are
uncertainties in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of

long-term variability and the time evolving pattern of forcing by, and
response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and
land surface changes.”

Perhaps one of the most important yet most ignored aspects of the IPCC

report is that it is actually quite explicit about the uncertainties surrounding a
link between human actions and global warming: “Although these global
mean results suggest that there is some anthropogenic component in the
observed temperature record, they cannot be considered compelling
evidence of a clear cause-and-effect link between anthropogenic forces and
changes in the Earth’s surface temperature.” Remember, the IPCC is
supposed to provide the scientific basis for the alarmists’ conclusions about
global warming. Yet, even the IPCC admitted that its own science cannot be
considered compelling evidence.

Dr. John Christy, professor of Atmospheric Science and director of the

Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and
a key contributor to the 1995 IPCC report, participated with the lead authors
in the drafting sessions and in the detailed review of the scientific text. He
wrote in the Montgomery Advertiser on February 22, 1998, that much of
what passes for common knowledge in the press regarding climate change is
“inaccurate, incomplete or viewed out of context.”67 Dr. Christy said that
many of the misconceptions about climate change originated from the IPCC’s
six-page executive summary, rather than the final report. It was the most
widely read and quoted of the three documents published by the IPCC’s
Working Group, but, Christy said— and this point is crucial—it had the
“least input from scientists and the greatest input from non-scientists.”68

IPCC PLAYS HOCKEY AND LOSES
Five years later, the IPCC was back at it again, this time with the Third
Assessment Report on Climate Change. In October 2000, the IPCC Summary
for Policymakers was leaked to the media, which once again accepted the
IPCC’s conclusions as fact.

Based on the summary, The Washington Post wrote on October 30, 2000,
“The consensus on global warming keeps strengthening.”69 In a similar vein,
the New York Times confidently declared on October 28, 2000, “The
international panel of climate scientists considered the most authoritative
voice on global warming has now concluded that mankind’s contribution to

the problem is greater than originally believed.”70 Of course, these accounts
were worded to maximize the fear factor, and upon closer inspection they
had no compelling intellectual content. “Greater than originally believed”?
Was that .01 percent, or 25 percent? And how much is greater? Double?
Triple?

Such reporting prompted testimony by Dr. Richard Lindzen before the

Committee on Environment and Public Works in May of 2001. Lindzen said,
“Almost all reading and coverage of the IPCC is restricted to the highly
publicized Summaries for Policymakers, which are written by
representatives from governments, NGOs and business; the full reports,
written by participating scientists, are largely ignored.”71 Of course, the
Policymaker’s Summary was politicized and radically differed from an
earlier draft. For example, the draft concluded the following concerning the
driving causes of climate change:

From the body of evidence since IPCC (1996), we conclude that there
has been a discernible human influence on global climate. Studies are
beginning to separate the contributions to observed climate change
attributable to individual external influences, both anthropogenic and
natural. This work suggests that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are a
substantial contributor to the observed warming, especially over the past
30 years. However, the accuracy of these estimates continues to be
limited by uncertainties in estimates of internal variability, natural and
anthropogenic forcing, and the climate response to external forcing.

The final version, however, looked quite different and concluded instead,

“In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining
uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely
to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.”

This kind of distortion was not unintentional. As Dr. Lindzen explained

before the EPW Committee, “I personally witnessed coauthors forced to
assert their ‘green’ credentials in defense of their statements.”72 In short,
some parts of the IPCC process resembled a Soviet-style trial: facts were
predetermined and ideological purity trumped technical and scientific rigor.
The most egregious flaw in the Third Assessment is undoubtedly the now

infamous hockey stick graph produced by Dr. Michael Mann and others,

which the IPCC enthusiastically embraced.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Working Group 1, Climate
Change Tool: The Scientific Basis, 2001

Mann’s study concluded that the twentieth century was the warmest on

record in the last one thousand years, showing flat temperatures until 1900,
and then spiking upward. Put simply, it looked like a hockey stick. The cause
for such a shift, of course, is attributed to industrialization and man-made
greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion is that industrialization, which
spawned widespread use of fossil fuels, was causing the planet to warm.

The hockey stick achieved instant fame as proof that humans were causing
global warming because it was featured prominently in the Summary Report
read by the media—and eventually Al Gore made it mainstream in his
documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.

But the problems with Mann’s study were immense. First of all, it focuses

on temperature trends only in the Northern Hemisphere. Mann extrapolated
that data to reach the conclusion that global temperatures remained relatively
stable and then dramatically increased at the beginning of the twentieth
century. That leads to Mann’s conclusion that the twentieth century has been
the warmest in the last one thousand years. As is obvious, however, such an

extrapolation cannot provide a reliable global perspective of long-term
climate trends.

Mann’s conclusions were also drawn mainly from twelve sets of climate

proxy data, of which nine were tree rings, while the remaining three came
from ice cores. Ice core data was drawn from Greenland and Peru. What’s
left is a picture of the Northern Hemisphere based on eight sets of tree-ring
data. Again, hardly a convincing global picture of the last one thousand
years.

In other words, Mann’s hockey stick completely dismisses both the

Medieval Warm Period (800 to 1300) and the Little Ice Age (1300 to 1900),
two climate events that are widely recognized in the scientific literature.
Mann said the twentieth century was “nominally the warmest” of the past
millennium and that the decade of the 1990s was the warmest decade on
record. The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are replaced by a
largely benign and slightly cooling linear trend in climate until 1900. But as
is clear from a close analysis of Mann’s methods, the hockey stick is formed
by crudely grafting the surface temperature record of the twentieth century
onto a pre-1900 tree-ring record.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change, The IPCC
Scientific Assessment 202 (1990).

It was a highly controversial and scientifically flawed approach. As was
widely recognized in the scientific community, two data series representing
radically different variables (temperature and tree rings) cannot be grafted
together credibly to create a single series. In simple terms, as Dr. Patrick
Michaels of the University of Virginia explained, this is like “comparing
apples to oranges.”73 Even Mann and his coauthors admitted that if the tree
ring data set were removed from their climate reconstruction, the calibration
and verification procedures they used would undermine their conclusions.

A study from Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics strongly

disputed Mann’s methods and hypotheses. As coauthor Dr. David Legates
wrote, “Although [Mann’s work] is now widely used as proof of
anthropogenic global warming, we’ve become concerned that such an
analysis is in direct contradiction to most of the research and written
histories available…Our paper shows this contradiction and argues that the
results of Mann… are out of step with the preponderance of the evidence.”74
Indeed, Mann’s theory of global warming was out of step with most scientific
thinking on the subject. Dr. Hans von Storch, a prominent German researcher
with the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research who believes in global
warming put it this way: “We were able to show in a publication in Science
that the [hockey stick] graph contains assumptions that are not permissible.
Methodologically it is wrong: rubbish.”75

Dr. von Storch was not the only one who felt that way. Three

geophysicists from the University of Utah, in the April 7, 2004, edition of
Geophysical Research Letters, concluded that Mann’s methods used to
create his temperature reconstruction were deeply flawed. In fact, their
judgment was harsher than that. As they wrote, Mann’s results are “based on
using end points in computing changes in an oscillating series” and are “just
bad science.” I repeat: “just bad science.”

My concerns about the “hockey stick” in those early days were validated

later in 2005 when two Canadian researchers, Steven McIntyre and Ross
McKitrick, essentially tore apart its statistical foundation. In essence, they
discovered that Dr. Mann misused an established statistical method called
principal components analysis (PCA). As they explained, Mann created a
program that “effectively mines a data set for hockey stick patterns.”76 In
other words, no matter what kind of data one uses, even if it is random and
totally meaningless, the Mann method always produces a hockey stick. After
conducting some 10,000 data simulations, the result was nearly always the
same. “In over 99 percent of cases,” McIntyre and McKitrick wrote, “it
produced a hockey stick shaped PCI series.”77 Statistician Francis Zwiers of
Environment Canada, a government agency, said he agreed that Dr. Mann’s
statistical method “preferentially produces hockey sticks when there are none
in the data.”78 Even to a non-statistician, this looked extremely troubling. But
that statistical error was just the beginning. On a public Web site where Dr.
Mann filed data, McIntyre and McKitrick discovered an intriguing folder

titled “BACKTO_1400-CENSORED.” What McIntyre and McKitrick found
in the folder was disturbing: Mann’s hockey stick blade was based on a
certain type of tree—a bristlecone pine—that, in effect, helped to
manufacture the hockey stick.

So why was the bristlecone pine important? The bristlecone experienced

a growth pulse in the Western United States in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. However, this growth pulse, as the specialist literature has
confirmed, was not attributed to temperature. So using those pines, and only
those pines as a proxy for temperature during this period is questionable at
best. Even Mann’s co-author has stated that the bristlecone growth pulse is a
“mystery.” Because of these obvious problems, McIntyre and McKitrick
appropriately excluded the bristlecone data from their calculations. What did
they find? Not the Mann hockey stick, to be sure, but a confirmation of the
Medieval Warm Period, which Mann’s work had erased. As the CENSORED
folder revealed, Mann and his colleagues never reported results obtained
from calculations that excluded the bristlecone data. It appeared to be a case
of selectively using data—that is, if you don’t like the result, remove the
offending data until you get the answer you want. As McIntyre and McKitrick
explained, “Imagine the irony of this discovery…Mann accused us of
selectively deleting North American proxy series. Now it appeared that he
had results that were exactly the same as ours, stuffed away in a folder
labeled CENSORED.”

McIntyre and McKitrick believed there were additional errors in the
Mann hockey stick. To confirm their suspicion, they need additional data
from Dr. Mann, including the computer code he used to generate the graph.
But Dr. Mann refused to supply it. As he told the Wall Street Journal,
“Giving them the algorithm would be giving in to the intimidation tactics that
these people are engaged in.”79

Intimidation tactics? On April 12, 2005, I gave a speech on the Senate

floor explaining McIntyre and McKitrick’s findings and, as I said, “Mr.
McIntyre and Mr. McKitrick were just trying to find the truth. What is Dr.
Mann trying to hide?” Well, as the Climategate scandal eventually revealed,
he may have been trying to “hide the decline” in temperatures, but we will
get to that later.

In June 2006, the National Academy of Science released its study,

“Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years” which

acknowledged that there were “relatively warm conditions centered around
A.D. 1000 (identified by some as the ‘Medieval Warm Period’) and a
relatively cold period (or ‘Little Ice Age’) centered around 1700.” This
report refuted the hockey stick which showed temperatures in the Northern
Hemisphere remained relatively stable over nine hundred years, then spiked
upward in the twentieth century. The NAS report also stated that “substantial
uncertainties” surround Mann’s claims that the last few decades of the
twentieth century were the warmest in last one thousand years. In fact, while
the report conceded that temperature data uncertainties increase going
backward in time, it acknowledged that “not all individual proxy records
indicate that the recent warmth is unprecedented.” In one last blow, the NAS
reports stated, “Even less confidence can be placed in the original
conclusions by Mann et al. (1999) that ‘the 1990s are likely the warmest
decade and 1998 the warmest year in at least a millennium.” When that
report appeared, it only confirmed what I had been saying all along: the
hockey stick was broken.

Climate alarmists have long been attempting to erase this inconvenient

Medieval Warm Period from the Earth’s climate history for at least a decade
because it doesn’t fit in with their theories of catastrophe. David Deming,
who at the time was an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma’s
College of Geosciences, understood this all too well. Dr. Deming was
welcomed into the close-knit group of global warming believers after he
published a paper in 1995 that noted some warming in the twentieth century.
Deming says he was subsequently contacted by a prominent global warming
alarmist who told him point-blank, “We have to get rid of that Medieval
Warm Period.”80 When the “hockey stick” first appeared in 1998, it did just
that. And yet, the IPCC immortalized the hockey stick as incontrovertible
proof of catastrophic global warming.

IPCC: POLITICS, NOT SCIENCE
How could the IPCC so blatantly move forward with arguments based on
such dubious science? I had an answer to that question as early as my 2003
speech.

First, the IPCC is a political institution. Its whole purpose is to support
the efforts of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has
the basic mission of eliminating the “threat” of global warming. This clearly

creates a conflict of interest with the standard scientific goal of assessing
scientific data in an objective manner. The Summary for Policymakers
illustrates some of the problems with this: it was not approved by the
scientists and economists who contributed to the report. It was approved by
intergovernmental delegates—in short, politicians. It doesn’t take a leap of
imagination to realize that politicians will insist the report supports their
political agenda. Both scientists and economists complained that the
summary did not adequately reflect the uncertainties associated with tentative
conclusions in the basic report. The uncertainties identified by contributing
authors and reviewers seemed to disappear or were downplayed in the
summary.

In other words, the lead authors and the chair of the IPCC control too
much of the process. The old adage “power corrupts, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely” applies. Only a handful of individuals were involved in
changing the entire tone of the second assessment. Likewise, Michael Mann
was a chapter lead author in the third assessment.

One stark example of how the process has been corrupted involves a U.S.
government scientist who was among the world’s most respected experts on
hurricanes, Dr. Christopher Landsea, who eventually resigned as a
contributing author of the fourth assessment. His reason was simple—the
lead author for the chapter on extreme weather, Dr. Kevin Trenberth, had
demonstrated he may pursue a political agenda linking global warming to
more severe hurricanes. Trenberth had spoken at a forum where he was
introduced as a lead author and proceeded forcefully to make the link. The
only problem is that Trenberth’s views may not have been widely accepted
among the scientific community. As Landsea explained, “All previous and
current research in the area of hurricane variability has shown no reliable,
long-term trend up in the frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones, either in
the Atlantic or any other basin.”81

When Landsea brought it to the attention of the IPCC, he was told that
Trenberth—who as lead author is supposed to bring a neutral, unbiased
perspective to his position—would keep his position. Landsea concluded
that, “because of Dr. Trenberth’s pronouncements, the IPCC process on our
assessment of these crucial extreme events in our climate system has been
subverted and compromised, its neutrality lost.”

Landsea’s experience is not unique. Richard Lindzen, a prominent MIT

researcher who was a contributing author to a chapter in the third assessment,
said that the summary did not reflect the chapter to which he contributed. But
when you examine how the IPCC is structured, is it really so surprising? The
IPCC has consistently demonstrated an unreasoning resistance to accepting
constructive critiques of its scientific and economic methods. I said that this
was a recipe for de-legitimizing the entire endeavor in terms of providing
credible information that is useful to policymakers.

I explained a few examples of this on the Senate floor in 2003. First,

malaria is considered one of the four greatest risks associated with global
warming. But the relationship between climate and mosquito populations is
highly complex. There are more than thirty-five hundred species of mosquito,
and all breed, feed, and behave differently. Yet the nine lead authors of the
health section in the second assessment had published only six research
papers on vector-borne diseases among them. Dr. Paul Reiter of the Pasteur
Institute, a respected entomologist who has spent decades studying mosquito-
borne malaria, believes that global warming would have little impact on the
spread of malaria. But the IPCC refused to consider his views in its third
assessment, and completely excluded him from contributing to the fourth
assessment.

Here’s another example: To predict future global warming, the IPCC
estimated how much world economies would grow over the next century.
Future increases in carbon dioxide emission estimates are directly tied to
growth rates, which, in turn, drive the global warming predictions. However,
the method the IPCC used to calculate growth rates was wrong. It also
contained assumptions that developing nations will experience explosive
growth—in some cases, becoming wealthier than the United States. These
combine to greatly inflate even its lower-end estimates of future global
warming. The IPCC, however, bowed to political pressure from the
developing countries that refused to acknowledge the likelihood that they
will not catch up to the developed world. The result: Future global warming
predictions by the IPCC were based on a political choice, not on credible
economic methodologies.

Likewise, the IPCC ignored the advice of economists who concluded that
if global warming is real, future generations would have a higher quality of
life if societies maximize economic growth and adapt to future warming
rather than trying to drastically curb emissions. This problem with the

economics led to a full-scale inquiry by the UK’s House of Lords Select
Committee on Economic Affairs, which found numerous problems with the
IPCC. In fact, the problems they identified were so substantial, it led Lord
Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Member of the
Committee, to state: “I believe the IPCC process is so flawed, and the
institution, it has to be said, so closed to reason, that it would be far better to
thank it for the work it has done, close it down, and transfer all future
international collaboration on the issue of climate change.”82

These were the red flags that I examined with a vengeance from 2003 on.

As more and more problems continued to surface with the IPCC, I warned
that the entire institution would lose its credibility altogether if it did not take
drastic steps to remedy the situation.

2005: REFORM NEEDED AT THE IPCC
In December 2005, as the IPCC was preparing to issue its fourth assessment
report, I wrote to Dr. R.K. Pachauri, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, explaining my concern that certain scientific conclusions are
selected or excluded from the IPCC’s consideration and presentation, and
how the science has been manipulated in order to reach a predetermined
conclusion. I objected to the comments he made in Montreal earlier that year
where he stated, “In the fourth assessment, we will conduct an extensive
outreach effort. If facts are highlighted, not exaggerated… then it will help in
changing public perception.”83 I told him that such an effort was in direct
conflict with an objective assessment of the science, which should be free of
political goals. Selective presentations of facts, whether accurate or not,
skew the public’s understanding of the issue by eliminating contrary findings
and potentially considerable uncertainty about their accuracy.

I said that these problems must be remedied in order for the IPCC to
present a fair and impartial conclusion as to the current state of climate
science, and therefore regain its credibility. I wrote that the IPCC must adopt
procedures that ensure that impartial scientific reviewers formally approve
both the chapters and the Summary for Policymakers—the latter of which is
the only document that members of the press and members of Congress ever
read. When compared with the actual report, it was clear the Summary for
Policymakers was being co-opted by activists with an agenda to shape the
conclusions to show that man-made emissions were causing catastrophic

global warming. To safeguard against the manipulation of the message,
objective scientists, not government delegates, should be a part of the
approval process. I also said that the IPCC must ensure that any uncertainties
in the state of knowledge be clearly expressed in the Summary for
Policymakers. But Dr. Pachauri dismissed my concerns. Here’s how Reuters
reported his response:

In the one-page letter, [Pachauri] denies that the IPCC has an alarmist
bias and says, ‘I have a deep commitment to the integrity and objectivity
of the IPCC process.’ Pachauri’s main argument is that the IPCC
comprises both scientists and more than 130 governments who approve
IPCC reports line by line. That helps ensure fairness, he says.84

My concerns were confirmed when the IPCC process finally imploded in

2009 with the Climategate scandal and the errors in the IPCC science
revealed in its wake, which showed once and for all that their process was
all politics; science was secondary, even non-essential, to the ultimate goal
of confirming catastrophic global warming and achieving global governance.

STATE OF FEAR: MICHAEL CRICHTON
As I was exposing flaws and inconsistencies of the IPCC science on the
Senate floor, bestselling author Dr. Michael Crichton was doing it through
fiction—it was, as the saying goes, art imitating life. In 2004, Dr. Crichton
published State of Fear, a fascinating novel that questions the scientific
consensus of man-made catastrophic global warming, while also predicting
much of how the global warming debate would pan out. If I was the one-man
truth squad on Capitol Hill, surely Dr. Crichton was the one-man truth squad
in Hollywood.

With his scientific and medical background, Dr. Crichton made it a

practice to do extensive research before writing his books. For Congo, he
studied the Congo. In Airframe, he perfected the details of airframe structure.
But my favorite bestseller of all was State of Fear. Initially, Dr. Crichton
planned to write a novel about celebrities who warn about the dangers of
global warming and the disasters that they predict come true. But the more he
researched, the more he began to understand the true motives of the
movement, and instead wrote a book about how it all turned out to be a scam.
Of course, being from Hollywood and having been the force behind the

blockbuster, Jurassic Park, as well as the very popular series ER, he knew
the Hollywood elite mentality firsthand, and does an excellent job portraying
young actors who go out to evangelize about global warming. In fact, one
theme that State of Fear introduced and features brilliantly is the “religion”
of global warming.

Throughout the book, environmental organizations are focused squarely on
raising money, principally by scaring potential contributors with predictions
of a global apocalypse and claims that they are saving the world.

What is truly remarkable about Dr. Crichton’s book is just how accurately
it establishes the progression of the entire movement. The novel calls out the
media and Hollywood for its political agenda—which had not yet reached its
height when he wrote the book in 2004. At one point in the story, a young
actor called Ted Bradley films a scene where he lectures a group of third
graders about the dangers of global warming. As he says:

But now these magnificent trees—having survived the threat of fire, the
threat of logging, the threat of soil erosion, the threat of acid rain—now
face their greatest threat ever. Global warming. You kids know what
global warming is, don’t you?

Hands went up all around the circle. “I know, I know!”

“I’m glad you do,” Bradley said, gesturing for the kids to put their

hands down. The only person talking today would be Ted Bradley. “But
you may not know that global warming is going to cause a very sudden
change in our climate. Maybe just a few months or years, and it will
suddenly be much hotter or much colder. And there will be hordes of
insects and diseases that will take down these wonderful trees.”

[…]

By now the kids were fidgeting, and Bradley turned squarely to the

cameras. He spoke with the easy authority he had mastered while playing
the president for so many years on television. “The threat of abrupt
climate change,” he said, “is so devastating for mankind, and for all life
on this planet, that conferences are being convened all around the world
to deal with it. There is a conference in Los Angeles starting tomorrow,

where scientists will discuss what we can do to mitigate this terrible
threat. But if we do nothing, catastrophe looms. And these mighty,
magnificent trees will be a memory, a postcard from the past, a snapshot
of man’s inhumanity to the natural world. We’re responsible for
catastrophic climate change. And only we can stop it.”85
The novel also ventures into extensive detail about the science of the
IPCC, demonstrating the manipulation of data from the very beginning. It
even touches on some of the same problems I had exposed on the Senate
floor in 2003. As Dr. Crichton writes,

“… it is unquestionably manipulative. And Hansen’s testimony wasn’t the
only instance of media manipulation that’s occurred in the course of the
global warming sales campaign. Don’t forget the last-minute changes in
the 1995 IPCC report.”

“IPCC? What last minute changes?”

“The UN formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in

the late 1980s. That’s the IPCC… a huge group of bureaucrats, and
scientists under the thumb of bureaucrats. The idea was that since this
was a global problem, the UN would track climate research and issue
reports every few years. The first assessment report in 1990 said it
would be very difficult to detect a human influence on climate, although
everybody was concerned that one might exist. But the 1995 report
announced with conviction that there was now a ‘discernible human
influence’ on climate.”

“…a discernible human influence’ was written into the 1995 summary

report after the scientists themselves had gone home. Originally, the
document said scientists couldn’t detect a human influence on climate for
sure, and they didn’t know when they would. They said explicitly, ‘we
don’t know.’ That statement was deleted and replaced with a new
statement that a discernible human influence did indeed exist. It was a
major change.”86

Of course, the “major change” that Dr. Crichton accurately refers to is in

the IPCC’s second assessment, which I also discussed in my “Greatest Hoax”

speech. Dr. Crichton’s book also addresses the change in terms from “global
warming” to “climate change,” which didn’t happen in full force until after
the appearance of Al Gore’s global warming Hollywood hysteria film in
2006. In the novel, two of the characters, Drake and Henley, devise a way to
change the rhetoric to keep money flowing in as the issue of global warming
loses credibility:

“… You can’t raise a dime with it, especially in winter. Every time it
snows people forget all about global warming. Or else they decide some
warming might be a good thing after all. They’re trudging through the
snow, hoping for a little global warming. It’s not like pollution, John.
Pollution worked. It still works. Pollution scares… people. You tell ’em
they’ll get cancer, and the money rolls in. But nobody is scared of a little
warming. Especially if it won’t happen for a hundred years.”87

“So what you need … is to structure the information so that whatever

kind of weather occurs, it always confirms your message. That’s the
virtue of shifting the focus to abrupt climate change. It enables you to use
everything that happens. There will always be floods, and freezing
storms, and cyclones, and hurricanes. These events will always get
headlines and airtime. And in every instance, you can claim it as an
example of abrupt climate change caused by global warming. So the
message gets reinforced. The urgency is increased.”88

In the “Author’s Message” at the end of the book, Dr. Crichton’s words
are calm amid the building hysteria: “We are also in the midst of a natural
warming trend that began about 1850, as we emerged from a 400-year cold
spell known as the Little Ice Age”; “Nobody knows how much of the present
warming trend might be a natural phenomenon”; and, “Nobody knows how
much of the present trend might be man-made.” And for those who were
worried about impending disaster in the coming century, Dr. Crichton says, “I
suspect that people of 2100 will be much richer than we are, consume more
energy, have a smaller global population, and enjoy more wilderness than we
have today. I don’t think we have to worry about them.”

In 2005, I invited Dr. Crichton to testify at a Senate hearing on the “Role
of Science in Environmental Policy Making.” His appearance was ridiculed
by environmentalists and many Democratic Senators who dismissed his

testimony because he was a science fiction writer—of course, only a few
years later, those same Senators would invite the Hollywood elite to testify
on Capitol Hill as experts on the dangers of global warming. Dr. Crichton
was more than just a science fiction author. He was also a scientist and a
medical doctor who held degrees from Harvard College and Harvard
Medical School; was a visiting lecturer in Physical Anthropology at
Cambridge University; and a postdoctoral fellow at the Salk Institute. His
detractors didn’t understand that his testimony pulled back the curtain on the
manipulation of data by climate researchers, which would not be completely
understood until the Climategate scandal, four years later.

What he discovered in researching the science behind climate change was

that most of the research was being conducted by the same insular group of
scientists without any independent verification. His message at the Senate
hearing was very clear and should be endorsed by everyone who desires that
public policy be set by sound science. He stated:

In essence, science is nothing more than a method of inquiry. The method
says an assertion is valid—and will be universally accepted—only if it
can be reproduced by others, and thereby independently verified. The
scientific method is utterly apolitical. A truth in science is verifiable
whether you are black or white, male or female, old or young. It’s
verifiable whether you know the experimenter, or whether you don’t. It’s
verifiable whether you like the results of a study, or you don’t.

Thus, when adhered to, the scientific method can transcend politics.

Unfortunately, the converse may also be true: when politics takes
precedent over content, it is often because the primacy of independent
verification has been abandoned.

Verification may take several forms. I come from medicine, where the

gold standard is the randomized double-blind study. Not every study is
conducted in this way, but it is held up as the ultimate goal.

In climate research, the same small group of scientists conducts the

majority of the research and peer reviews each other’s work. A scientist peer
reviewing a colleague one year knows that that same colleague may be
reviewing their work the next year. To provide a direct contrast with the

research procedures in climate science, Dr. Crichton told the story of a
physician who was in the middle of an FDA study of a new drug. It was a
double-blind study so the different teams conducting the research were not
allowed to have any contact with the other teams as they worked, so as not to
contaminate the results. When this physician innocently met another
researcher from a different team while waiting at the airport, they were both
required to report their encounter to the FDA. As Dr. Crichton explained,
“For a person with a medical background, accustomed to this degree of rigor
in research, the protocols of climate science appear considerably more
relaxed.” As an example of this lax peer review, he specifically evaluated
the work of Dr. Mann and his hockey stick.

The American climate researcher Michael Mann and his co-workers
published an estimate of global temperatures from the year 1000 to 1980.
Mann’s results appeared to show a spike in recent temperatures that was
unprecedented in the last thousand years. His alarming report received
widespread publicity and formed the centerpiece of the UN’s Third
Assessment Report, in 2001. The graph appeared on the first page of the
IPCC Executive Summary.

Mann’s work was initially criticized because his graph didn’t show

the well-known Medieval Warm Period, when temperatures were
warmer than they are today, or the Little Ice Age, when they were colder
than today. But real fireworks began when two Canadian researchers,
McIntyre and McKitrick, attempted to replicate Mann’s study. They found
grave errors in the work, which they detailed in 2003: calculation errors,
data used twice, and a computer program that generated a hockeystick out
of any data fed to it—even random data.

Mann’s work has been dismissed as “phony” and “rubbish” by climate
scientists around the world who subscribe to global warming. Some have
asked why the UN accepted Mann’s report so uncritically. It is unsettling
to learn Mann himself was in charge of the section of the report that
included his work. This episode of climate science is far from the
standards of independent verification.

The hockeystick controversy drags on. But I would direct the

Committee’s attention to three aspects of this story. First, six years

passed between Mann’s publication and the first detailed accounts of
errors in his work. This is simply too long for policymakers to wait for
validated results. Particularly if it is going to be shown around the world
in the meantime.

Second, the flaws in Mann’s work were not caught by climate

scientists, but rather by outsiders—in this case, an economist and a
mathematician. McIntyre and McKitrick had to go to great lengths to
obtain the data from Mann’s team, which obstructed them at every turn.
When the Canadians sought help from the NSF, they were told that Mann
was under no obligation to provide his data to other researchers for
independent verification.

Third, this kind of stonewalling is not unique or uncommon. The

Canadians are now attempting to replicate other climate studies and are
getting the same runaround from other researchers. One leading light in
the field told them: “Why should I make the data available to you, when
your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?”

Even further, some scientists complain the task of archiving is so time-

consuming as to prevent them from getting any work done. But this is
nonsense.

Dr. Crichton was right. It is nonsense that climate science is not properly
peer-reviewed, it is nonsense that scientists do not share data, it is nonsense
for policymakers to set policy on research which cannot be replicated, and it
is nonsense to wreck economies and jobs based on this so-called research.

After the hearing, one of my staffers asked Dr. Crichton if the State of
Fear would ever be made into a movie. He said, “No, Hollywood would
never touch a film like this.” He said he had lost a lot of Hollywood friends
because of this book, but he felt that it still had to be written. Of course, at
the time, Hollywood had just premiered The Day After Tomorrow, a disaster
film that depicts the world’s untimely demise due to our failure to “act” on
global warming.

Even toward the end of his life, Dr. Crichton endured a good deal of

wrath from the environmental community, and many regarded him as a traitor
for portraying the errors in global warming science and exposing the

shallowness of the Hollywood elite. May he rest in peace now that he too is
vindicated. I invite you to read a few excerpts from State of Fear in
Appendix B.

THE PUSH FOR CAP AND TRADE BEGINS
In 2003, when I was fighting against the hoax of the science, I was also
fighting the hoax of the so-called solution to global warming: cap and trade
legislation.

Cap and trade achieved essentially the same outcome as the Kyoto Treaty:

it had the same $300–400 billion annual pricetag; it created the same
increased energy costs; it destroyed the same number of jobs; and brought the
same amount of economic pain to our country. It only bound the United States
to emissions reductions so, of course, jobs would be shipped overseas to
China, India, and across the border to Mexico, where they don’t have cap
and trade, which means that worldwide emissions would actually increase.
Honestly, if I had a dollar for every time I said that Kyoto or cap and trade
would have been all pain for no environmental gain, I think I would have a
million dollars just from that by now.

So what they couldn’t achieve through the Kyoto Treaty, they tried to

achieve through legislation.

Here’s how cap and trade for carbon dioxide emissions works: As the

government imposes caps on emissions, it essentially establishes an artificial
price for carbon. Each regulated entity may only emit a certain amount of
carbon, and if it exceeds that limit, it can buy credits from other entities that
are not exceeding their limits. Of course, higher emitting entities such as
coal-fired power plants, would have to purchase a large number of credits to
continue business as usual, and as President Obama said himself, “electricity
prices would necessarily skyrocket” because these costs “would be passed
on to consumers” in the form of an energy tax. Ultimately, the real losers in
this scenario would have been the American people, who would have had to
shoulder the largest tax increase in American history.

Of course, the philosophy behind cap and trade is that if we restrict

enough supply of fossil fuels, the price will increase, and we can then simply
shift to less costly alternatives. Yet this is wishful thinking. Alternatives are
fine, but in most cases, they aren’t widely available or commercially viable
yet—certainly not in a form that can efficiently, affordably, and reliably meet

our existing energy needs. How are we supposed to run this machine called
America without proven and reliable sources such as oil, coal, and natural
gas? The answer is we can’t.

All I knew was that there was no way cap and trade was going to pass out

of the Environment and Public Works Committee with me as chairman.

The first attempt to impose cap and trade came from Senators McCain and
Lieberman’s bill in 2003. As promised, I blocked it from moving through the
Committee, so in order to have their bill brought up for a vote, they had to
bypass the committee process and have it brought straight to the Senate floor.
At the time, Senator McCain was living up to his reputation for being a
maverick and bucking his own party. He had the support of the liberal media
and the Democrats in Congress. I handled the opposition on the floor, as few
Republican Senators dared to speak out against the bill. To put it simply,
many of my Republican colleagues were afraid that they too would see their
faces on an environmental WANTED poster.

In one lively floor debate, on October 30, 2003, Senator McCain, after

quoting Ernest Hemingway, made his case that global warming was a serious
threat and because of it “the snows of Kilimanjaro may soon exist only in
literature.” He went on to say, “These are facts. These are facts that cannot
be refuted by any scientist or any union or any special interest that is
weighing in more heavily on this issue than any issue since we got into
campaign finance reform.”

When it was my turn to speak, I said that while I appreciated the

comments made by my good friend from Arizona, what he was saying was
simply false. I then quoted an article from the front page of that morning’s
USA Today. It was about James Morison, a scientist with the University of
Washington, who said the temperature increases and the shifts in winds and
ocean currents that occurred early in the 1990s have since “relaxed” and
such changes in the Arctic Circle “are not related to (global) climate
change.”89 So it turned out that Senator McCain’s incontrovertible facts about
man-made catastrophic warming were refuted that very day.

Senator McCain immediately nabbed one of his staffers to ask why he

didn’t know about that article, and within moments, that staffer was rushing
out the door to go find it for his boss. In the end, even though few other
senators would come out publicly to oppose Senators McCain and

Lieberman’s bill, it was soundly defeated on the Senate floor by a vote of
55–43, with only forty-three senators supporting the measure.

Senators McCain and Lieberman, however, were determined to try again.
In 2005, they reintroduced their bill, again having to go around me because
they knew it had no shot at getting passed out of committee. When the 2005
Energy Policy Act (EPACT) was brought up for consideration, the senators
offered their bill as an amendment. McCain arranged an agreement with the
Senate Majority Leader that they would vote first on EPACT, then separately
on McCain and Lieberman’s amendment as a stand-alone bill, thus avoiding
the committee process. It was another lonely battle on the Senate floor, as I
was one of the only senators willing to openly stand in opposition. But while
my colleagues may not have expressed their dislike of the bill in words, they
certainly did so with their votes. McCain-Lieberman was dealt a crushing
defeat on June 22 by a 60–38 vote, with only thirty-eight senators supporting
the measure.

CLEAR SKIES

“The Clear Skies bill is the most aggressive presidential initiative in
history to reduce power plant pollution and provide cleaner air across
the country. The bill reduces emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
and—for the first time—mercury from power plants by 70 percent by
2018 through expanding the successful Acid Rain Trading Program. This
program, combined with the historic diesel rules being implemented by
the Bush Administration, provide a national clean air strategy that will
bring nearly all of the nation’s counties that are not meeting clean air
standards into attainment, makes the future for clean coal possible, and
keeps energy affordable, reliable and secure. It is my hope that if the
environmental community and my friends on the other side of the aisle are
truly serious about protecting the environment they will join me and
Senator Voinovich in supporting this important legislation.”

—Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman
James M. Inhofe, January 25, 200590

Most people are surprised to discover that while I was working to defeat

cap and trade, I was also simultaneously working to pass the Clear Skies

Act, which would have been the most aggressive legislation in history to
improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions by 70 percent.

EPA had declared that 474 U.S. counties were in non-attainment for the
new, more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
ozone, and that 225 counties did not meet new standards for particulate
matter. Non-attainment is determined by air monitoring devices placed
around cities all over the country. If any particular area violates the NAAQS
standards, then they are considered to be in non-attainment, which triggers a
number of regulatory requirements for that area until they can show that they
have attained the standards. Such designations place a significant burden on
state and municipal governments, forcing them to develop plans to reduce
emissions and reach attainment by a certain date. Typically cities in
nonattainment must reduce their emissions from motor vehicles (including
cars and buses) or by limiting the emissions from power plants and
manufacturing facilities. Failure to reach attainment can mean the rejection of
any permits for new businesses in the community and the threat of losing
federal highway dollars to improve the roads. Clear Skies, coupled with
diesel regulations that had already been finalized by EPA, would have
brought most of those counties into attainment without any additional, local
controls because it would have placed most of the burden on the electricity
sector, instead of state and municipal governments.

President Bush announced the Clear Skies Initiative in February 2002, and
I first introduced the corresponding legislation, along with Senator Voinovich
in November 2003, not long after McCain-Lieberman cap and trade
legislation was defeated the first time. Just before I introduced Clear Skies, I
met with President Bush to discuss the path forward. One thing that stands out
in my memory from that meeting is that he told me how much he envied me
for having so many kids and grandkids to go fishing with. He said that with
two daughters who didn’t like to fish, he’d have to wait until he had
grandkids. Here was a president who could truly relate as a fellow
sportsman, avid outdoorsman, and, most importantly, a family man.

After the Senate rejected cap and trade for greenhouse gases the first time,
I insisted that it was time to pass legislation that would actually provide real
public health and environmental benefits to the American people while
preserving our economy and standard of living. Yes, Clear Skies was a cap
and trade bill, but with one, crucial difference from the McCain-Lieberman
bill: it focused solely on reducing three real air pollutants: sulfur dioxide,

nitrogen oxide, and mercury (for the first time in history); it did not regulate
greenhouse gases.

Global warming advocates often accused Republicans of hypocrisy for
supporting cap and trade for real pollutants but not greenhouse gases. But
they confused the fact that trading mechanisms for real pollutants have
achieved significant environmental benefits without harming jobs and the
economy, claiming the same would happen for carbon despite every credible
economic analysis showing exactly the opposite. Placing a price on carbon
could wreak havoc on the economy. The reason trading programs work for
real pollutants is that they are mostly emitted by large, stationary, power-
generating sources, and controlled by existing technologies. Greenhouse
gases, on the other hand, are emitted everywhere and by every sector of the
economy, not just power plants, and they are not harmful to human health.
Because the foundation for Clear Skies was the successful Acid Rain

trading program advanced by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, we knew
the technology to make these reductions was viable and affordable, and that it
would not raise electricity costs for consumers. On the other hand, there was
no viable technology available for utilities to reduce carbon emissions. The
timetables of Clear Skies achieved significant reductions that were
reasonable, and the electric generating industry knew, from experience, that
they could comply. Also, unlike most of our nation’s environmental laws and
regulations under the Clean Air Act, which have resulted in endless
litigation, the Acid Rain program resulted in virtually no litigation and has
achieved goals of substantial reductions in acid rain at less than the
projected cost. Clear Skies similarly would have avoided that constant
litigation. It would have improved our air by reducing utility emissions
faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than the Clean Air Act as it still stands
today.

The legislation went nowhere during President Bush’s first term. Why

would Democrats want to hand a president they hated a key legislative
victory—on an issue they claim to own—before the 2004 elections?

In March 2005, Senator Voinovich and I brought the bill up again, but

again Democrats blocked its consideration because it still did not regulate
greenhouse gases, despite the fact that it would have made great strides in
improving air quality.

The way most Democrats tell it, the Grim Reaper waits outside your door
each and every day to blow toxins in your face. They would never admit that
at the time I re-introduced Clear Skies in the opening days of the 109th
Congress, emissions of the six main air pollutants had actually decreased 51
percent since 1970. That is a significant improvement over a thirty-five-year
period during which U.S. gross domestic product increased by 176 percent,
vehicle miles traveled increased 155 percent, energy consumption rose 45
percent, and population expanded by 39 percent. We could have built on
thirty-five years of success, but politics prevailed.

Well-financed environmental NGOs such as the National Resources

Defense Council and Sierra Club, or “Big Green” as I call them collectively,
launched an aggressive, politically coordinated campaign against Clear
Skies. The basis of their opposition was the false and utterly absurd claim
that Clear Skies was a “rollback” of existing Clean Air Act provisions. This
was simply not true. The real problem for Big Green was that the bill did not
address greenhouse gases. And my Democrat colleagues did not like that it
had been advanced by George W. Bush and me. Opponents amusingly called
Clear Skies “Orwellian.” The bill proposed the first-ever cap to reduce
mercury emissions from the power plants by 70 percent, yet, true to form,
these Big Green groups said it would allow more mercury to go into the air.
Go figure. Clear Skies opponents knew that it would be more difficult to pass
greenhouse gas regulations in addition to a three-pollutant bill. Because of
this, they held it hostage, making it very clear that politics, not the
environment, was the priority. Real and meaningful results for air quality
were shamefully sacrificed for worthless rhetoric.

In March 2005, the bill unfortunately failed by a 9–9 tie vote in

committee, thanks chiefly to Senator Lincoln Chafee, who went on to lose his
Republican-held seat in the Senate despite his calculated opposition to
appease the Big Green machine. Senator Voinovich and I made a number of
compromises to advance the legislation, and even agreed to postpone
scheduled markups three times in a good faith effort to work with opponents
to reach a consensus. In the end, after several months of markup delays,
twenty-four hearings, five years, and more than 10,000 pages of modeling
data, the Democrats succeeded in killing Clear Skies. If anyone was denied
an environmental victory, it was the American people.

THE BUILD-UP OF ALARMISM

CELEBRITIES AND THE “CLIMATE CRISIS”
Most people know that I’m not much of a movie-goer, and I can’t tell one
Hollywood star from another. Let’s just say that if you would have told me a
few years earlier that I would be giving PowerPoint presentations that
included quotes from the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand, and
John Travolta, I wouldn’t have believed you. But the alarmists had taken the
fight to pop culture, so I was determined to join in the fray.

After suffering two overwhelming defeats in Congress with the McCain-
Lieberman cap and trade bill, the environmental left realized that they had to
go bigger than Capitol Hill and take their alarmist message of fear directly to
the people. Conveniently, they had Hollywood and the mainstream media on
their side. It was a marriage made in heaven—or so they thought at the time.

By 2006, the American public was inundated with an unprecedented

parade of environmental alarmism though films and celebrities, all
portending a future of natural disasters, wars, displacements, and plagues.
They were also going full force with the major news organizations, which
had completely dismissed any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate
coverage and instead focused squarely on promoting global warming
advocacy. Basically, everywhere you turned you were bombarded with the
message that the end of the world was nigh.

There I was, this not particularly glamorous Senator from Oklahoma,

standing up against these young, beautiful celebrities who had come together
to proclaim with one voice that the science was settled and we had to act
immediately to avoid climate catastrophe.

But they had a little bit of a problem: their “solutions” were absurd.

Cameron Diaz stood on a stage at one particular climate concert and
proclaimed that women could mitigate global warming by turning off the

water in the shower when they shaved their legs;91 Laurie David, an activist
with strong ties to Hollywood, said that we needed to change our standard
light bulbs to fluorescents to avert crisis;92 and of course the most famous
“solution” came from Sheryl Crow who said a “limitation should be put on
how many squares of toilet paper can be used in one sitting.”93 That is,
unless there was a serious emergency, in which case more than one square
would be acceptable. She later claimed that she was just joking, but as I said
on Fox News, “I’m just glad she didn’t define what that serious emergency
was.”

There is certainly nothing wrong with the desire to conserve energy, but if

we were indeed facing a crisis of the proportions they predicted, the
suggestion that we can save the world one square of toilet paper at a time
was just absurd. In the midst of all this hysteria, my message remained calm,
consistent and clear: the science is not settled. Their so-called “solutions”
were only symbolic and would have no actual impact on the climate.

Looking back on these years, I’m sure that many people have probably

forgotten just how prevalent global warming was in the mainstream;

it seemed as if a day didn’t go by without hearing about the impending

doom. Now it is all but forgotten, but they will be back.

HOLLY WOOD HYSTERIA
Of course, of all the efforts to push alarmism, nothing was bigger than Al
Gore’s documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, which rocketed the global
warming movement into pop culture. Suddenly the alarmists had the hero they
were craving: Gore was now the “climate prophet” or the “Goricle” as
journalist Howard Fineman once called him.94 Katie Couric famously said
that Gore was a “Secular Saint,”95 and Oprah Winfrey said that he was the
“Noah”96 of our time. This is what I’m talking about when I say that it was a
religion to them.

But if Gore was a prophet, he was certainly a prophet of doom. Even the
trailer to the film flashes ominous images of destruction accompanied with
phrases such as “Nothing is scarier than the truth;” “By far the most terrifying
film you will ever see;” it’s a “film that has shocked audiences worldwide.”
Given the twenty significant scientific errors I found in Gore’s film, it was
clear that the science was secondary to the primary goal of promoting fear

and pushing the message that the debate was over and the science was
settled.

Gore chose to ignore those inconvenient scientists such as Richard

Lindzen of MIT who put it well when he said, “A general characteristic of
Mr. Gore’s approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its
climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external
forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in
order to exploit that fear is much worse.”97

The architect behind bringing the global warming alarmism message to
Hollywood was Laurie David, an environmental activist with close ties to
Hollywood. She convinced Gore to turn the PowerPoint presentation that he
was giving across the world into a documentary and became a co-producer
of the film. She was also behind numerous one-sided fear mongering
documentaries that aired on TBS, CNN, HBO, and even Fox News. She
teamed up with her husband to produce a two-hour comedy on TBS called
“Earth to America,” which included numerous stars—most notably Will
Ferrell—in a hilarious spoof of President George Bush complaining that
liberals were trying to make him “look bad” by “using such things as facts
and scientific data.”98

Later in 2007, Leonardo DiCaprio followed suit and completely tossed
objective scientific truth out the window in a documentary scarefest called
The 11th Hour. Like Gore and David, DiCaprio refused to acknowledge any
scientists who disagreed with his dire vision of the future of the Earth. In
fact, his film featured physicist Stephen Hawking making the unchallenged
assertion that “the worst-case scenario is that Earth would become like its
sister planet, Venus, with a temperature of 250 [degrees] centigrade.”99 In
other words, worst-case scenarios pass for science in Hollywood—in fact,
they are preferred. DiCaprio was not shy about stating that this was the
purpose of the film. As he said, “I want the public to be very scared by what
they see. I want them to see a very bleak future.”100 They may have been too
scared even to attend as the film itself was apparently a miserable flop.

While the target was essentially everyone, the alarmists were particularly

focused on planting the seed of fear in the young. DiCaprio announced his
goal was to recruit young eco-activists to the cause: “We need to get kids
young,” He said in an interview with USA Weekend.101 Laurie David also
coauthored a children’s global warming book with Cambria Gordon for

Scholastic Books titled, The Down-To-Earth Guide to Global Warming.
David made it clear the purpose of her book was to influence young minds
when she wrote in an open letter to her children, “We want you to grow up to
be activists.”102

After a successful campaign to have An Inconvenient Truth shown in
classrooms around the nation, the alarmists were unfortunately having the
impact they wanted on children: Nine-year-old Alyssa Luz-Ricca was quoted
in The Washington Post on April 16, 2007, as saying: “I worry about [global
warming] because I don’t want to die.”103

I remember one morning, when I was grocery shopping back home in

Tulsa with Kay, a young mother introduced herself and told me how worried
she was that her child had been made to watch An Inconvenient Truth in
several classes at school without being told there was another side to the
story. These poor kids were being bombarded with a scientifically unfounded
doomsday message designed to create fear, nervousness, and ultimately
recruit them to liberal activism.

MEDIA MANIA: COOLING OR WARMING CATASTROPHE?
Through it all, the mainstream media had nothing but praise for these efforts.
I almost don’t blame the major news outlets for jumping on global warming
hysteria with a vengeance. Let’s be honest: catastrophe sells news. So rather
than focus on the hard science of global warming, and looking at all the
possibilities, the media instead became prime advocates for hyping
scientifically unfounded climate alarmism.

Such tactics had certainly worked to their advantage before. Take, for

example, a quote from the New York Times reporting fears of an approaching
ice age: “Geologists Think the World May be Frozen Up Again.”104 That
sentence appeared more than one hundred years ago in the February 24,
1895, edition of the New York Times. Then a front-page article in the October
7, 1912, New York Times, just a few months after the Titanic struck an
iceberg and sank, declared that a prominent professor “Warns Us of an
Encroaching Ice Age.”105 The very same day in 1912, the Los Angeles Times
ran an article warning that the “Human race will have to fight for its
existence against cold.”106 An August 10, 1923, a Washington Post article
declared: “Ice Age Coming Here.”107

By the 1930s, the media took a break from reporting on the coming ice age

and instead switched gears to promoting global warming: “America in
Longest Warm Spell Since 1776; Temperature Line Records a 25-year Rise,”
stated an article in the New York Times on March 27, 1933.108 The media of
yesteryear was also not above injecting large amounts of fear and alarmism
into their climate articles. An August 9, 1923, front-page article in the
Chicago Tribune declared: “Scientist Says Arctic Ice Will Wipe Out
Canada.”109 The article quoted a Yale University professor who predicted
that large parts of Europe and Asia would be “wiped out” and Switzerland
would be “entirely obliterated.” A December 29, 1974, New York Times
article on global cooling reported that climatologists believed “the facts of
the present climate change are such that the most optimistic experts would
assign near certainty to major crop failure in a decade.”110 The article also
warned that unless government officials reacted to the coming catastrophe,
“mass deaths by starvation and probably in anarchy and violence” would
result. In 1975, the New York Times reported that “A major cooling [was]
widely considered to be inevitable.”111 These past predictions of doom have
a familiar ring, don’t they?

During the latest global warming craze, the image that stands out the most
is the Time magazine cover picturing the last remaining polar bear standing
on the one remaining ice cube under the heading “Be Worried, Be Very
Worried.”112 I joked that Americans should be very worried—about such
shoddy journalism. After more than a century of alternating between global
cooling and warming, one would think that this media history would serve a
cautionary tale for today’s voices in the media and scientific community who
were promoting yet another round of eco-doom.

After I presented the media’s one-hundred-year-history of embarrassing
climate change reporting in a speech on the Senate floor in October 2006,
Newsweek magazine Senior Editor Jerry Adler issued a one-thousand-word
correction113 for its 1975 story on the dangers of global cooling that, as the
article said, “may portent a drastic decline in food production—with serious
political implications for just about every nation on Earth.”114 It took them
thirty-one years to admit that that these statements were “so spectacularly
wrong about the near-term future.”115 But Adler still wasn’t willing to put the
full blame on Newsweek for this incredible gaffe. As he said, “The story
wasn’t ‘wrong’ in the journalistic sense of ‘inaccurate.’”116 His justification

was that “Some scientists indeed thought the Earth might be cooling in the
1970s, and some laymen—even one as sophisticated and well-educated as
Isaac Asimov—saw potentially dire implications for climate and food
production.”117 Yet, he was still unwilling to admit that what the media now
says about global warming could be wrong, as it was in the 1970s. So I’m
guessing that if it takes thirty one years for Newsweek to admit its mistakes,
we can expect them to recant their latest global warming scare around
October 2037.

But Adler was right in one respect. He also said, “All in all, it’s probably

just as well that society elected not to follow one of the possible solutions
mentioned in the Newsweek article: to pour soot over the Arctic ice cap, to
help it melt.”118

Newsweek was not the only publication that responded to me calling them

out over their past climate debacles. The New York Times also weighed in
with an October editorial:

We do not expect Mr. Inhofe to see the light—or feel the heat—any time
soon. He and his staff are serious collectors of opposition research. But
the essence of his strategy is to seize upon a mistaken or overblown story
to try to undermine the broad consensus. If that fails, he can always
question his opponents’ politics and motives, as with his insinuations that
environmentalists dreamed the whole thing up to scare people and raise
money.119
In other words, even though the New York Times was completely wrong
about global cooling in the 1970s, they were outraged that I would have the
audacity to question the validity of their claim that there is a “broad
consensus” among scientists regarding global warming today.

Even my favorite global warming reporter, Miles O’Brien, wasn’t too

happy when I challenged him on his past climate cooling gaffes. Miles was
great: so many extremists were mad all the time, but Miles always smiled,
even when he was cutting my guts out, and I appreciated that. Here’s the
exchange in one of our typically lively television interviews:

INHOFE: And I wonder also, Miles, it wasn’t long ago—you’ve got to
keep everyone hysterical all the time. You were the one that said another
ice age is coming just twelve years ago.

O’BRIEN: I said that? I didn’t say that.

INHOFE: You didn’t say that. Let me quote you…

O’BRIEN: No, no, no. I’d be willing to tell you there are stories like
that. But there’s not…

INHOFE: … quote you so I’ll be accurate. I don’t want to be inaccurate.

O’BRIEN: All right, go ahead.

INHOFE: You said, in talking about a shift that was coming—you said,
“If the Gulf Stream were to shift again, the British Isles could be engulfed
in polar ice and Europe’s climate could become frigid. [From CNN
Transcript titled Scientists Research the Rapidity of the Ice Age dated
December 19, 1992.]” That’s another scary story.

O’BRIEN: But that also is a potential outgrowth of global warming
when you talk about the ocean currents being arrested. This is “The Day
After Tomorrow” scenario that we’re talking about.

So global cooling was actually global warming. They were determined to

have their catastrophe no matter what.120

MEDIA MANIA OVER GORE
Not surprisingly, Al Gore had the full backing of the media to promote his
movie, and leading the cheerleading charge was none other than the
Associated Press. On June 27, 2006, an AP article written by Seth
Borenstein boldly declared: “Scientists give two thumbs up to Gore’s
movie.”121 The article states that the top scientists were giving his movie five
stars for accuracy and that its prospects of “a flooded New York City, an
inundated Florida, more and nastier hurricanes, worsening droughts,
retreating glaciers and disappearing ice sheets” were mostly accurate, with
only some minor adjustments.

Of course, the AP chose to ignore the scores of scientists who have
harshly criticized the science in Gore’s movie. I said that the AP should
release the names of the “more than 100 top climate researchers” that they

attempted to contact, and the nineteen scientists who gave Gore “five stars
for accuracy.” Most importantly, the AP chose to ignore Gore’s reliance on
the “hockey stick” by Dr. Michael Mann, which claims that temperatures in
the Northern Hemisphere remained relatively stable over nine hundred years,
then spiked upward in the twentieth century, and that the 1990s were the
warmest decade in at least one thousand years. Only a week before the AP
article was published, the National Academy of Sciences report dispelled
Mann’s oft-cited claims by reaffirming the existence of both the Medieval
Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.122 That’s when I declared on the Senate
floor that the hockey stick was broken. Yet, this highly significant breaking
news is not even acknowledged in this article which instead features only
glowing praise from the likes of Robert Corell, chairman of the worldwide
Arctic Climate Impact Assessment group of scientists, who said he was
“amazed at how thorough and accurate” it was; he was “blown away” and
“could find no error.”123

WHAT BALANCE?
This AP article epitomizes the attitude of many journalists around that time:
balance in global warming reporting simply wasn’t valued, and many were
not at all afraid to admit that openly. The quote that perhaps encapsulates the
global warming mania in the mainstream media most comes from Bill
Blakemore with ABC News, who explained on August 30, 2006, “After
extensive searches, ABC News has found no such [scientific] debate” on
global warming.124

ABC News put forth its best effort to secure its standing as an advocate
for climate alarmism when the network put out a call for people to submit
their anecdotal global warming horror stories in June 2006 for use in a future
news segment.125 Then, in July of that year, the Discovery Channel presented
a documentary on global warming, narrated by former NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw. You don’t have to take my word on the program’s overwhelming
bias; a Bloomberg News TV review noted, “You’ll find more dissent at a
North Korean political rally than in this program” because of its lack of
scientific objectivity.126

Brokaw, who had affiliations with the Sierra Club, lavishly praised

Gore’s film as “stylish and compelling,” called the science behind
catastrophic human caused global warming “irrefutable” and specifically

presented climate alarmist James Hansen’s views as unbiased. Of course, he
failed to note Hansen’s quarter-million-dollar grant from the partisan Heinz
Foundation or his endorsement of Democrat Presidential nominee John Kerry
in 2004 and his role promoting former Vice President Gore’s Hollywood
movie.

Brokaw, however, did find time to impugn the motives of scientists

skeptical of climate alarmism when he featured paid environmental partisan
Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund, accusing skeptics
of being bought out by the fossil fuel interests. Whenever the media asked me
how much I have received in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel
industry, my unapologetic answer was “not enough”—especially when you
consider the millions partisan environmental groups pour into political
campaigns.

Former Colorado state climatologist and professor emeritus of

atmospheric sciences at Colorado State University, Senior Research Scientist
in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences
(CIRES), and Senior Research Associate in the Department of Atmospheric
and Oceanic Sciences (ATOC) Roger Pielke Sr., viewed an advance copy of
Brokaw’s special and declared that it contained “errors and misconceptions”
and “relied on just a few scientists with a particular personal viewpoint on
this subject which misleads the public on the broader view that is actually
held by most climate scientists.”127

In March of that year, 60 Minutes profiled NASA scientist and alarmist
James Hansen, who was once making allegations of being censored by the
Bush administration.128 Many at that time pointed out the irony of a man who
claimed to be censored, yet was appearing frequently on every major
network.

In this segment, objectivity and balance were again tossed aside in favor
of a one-sided glowing profile of their hero Hansen. It made no mention of
Hansen’s ties to quarter-of-a-million-dollar grant from the left-wing Heinz
Foundation run by Teresa Heinz Kerry. Neither did 60 Minutes inform
viewers that Hansen appeared to concede in a 2003 issue of Natural Science
that the use of “extreme scenarios” to dramatize climate change “may have
been appropriate at one time” to drive the public’s attention to the issue.129
To put the severity of this lack of balance in perspective, one of Laurie

David’s one-sided documentaries, featuring David herself as well as Robert

Kennedy Jr., was even aired on Fox News in November 2005.130 As the Fox
News promotional article said, they were “committed to teaching everyday
Americans and the rest of the world about what can be done to cut down on
greenhouse gases that threaten our children’s future.” The surprise of seeing
such a one-sided documentary on Fox was not lost on the rest of the
mainstream media. The Los Angeles Times reported, “When Dan Becker,
director of the Sierra Club’s global-warming program, got a call from the
network this summer asking him to be interviewed for the documentary, he
initially thought it was a prank call. ‘I asked whether they were joking,’ said
Becker, who participated and noted that he was ultimately impressed by the
network’s questions.”131 When I found out that Fox News was moving
forward with this unbalanced documentary, I immediately called Roger
Ailes, who is the president of the network, and he conceded that it was not a
journalistically balanced approach. He agreed then to feature another
documentary that tells the other side of the story.

Perhaps the funniest example of the lack of balance in environmental

reporting comes from a particular ad by CBS News seeking a “Hip
Environmental Reporter” with no need to have “knowledge of the enviro
beat” but must be “funny, irreverent and hip, oozing enthusiasm and creative
energy.” This employee must be “vibrant” and bring “a dash of humor to our
coverage.” I actually gave them credit for coming out and admitting that being
“hip” was the most important thing for selling what was then the “cool”
environmental agenda.132

LAST POLAR BEAR STANDING ON THE LAST CUBE OF ICE
Through it all, the last polar bear standing on the last cube of ice remained
the image seared in everyone’s mind from the media of why we should be
worried—very worried about global warming.

On August 3, 2006, the New York Times ran an op-ed by Bob Herbert

called “Hot Enough Yet?” which claimed that polar bears were “drowning
because they can’t swim far enough to make it from one ice floe to
another.”133 Then a Reuters article dated September 15, 2006, by
correspondent Alister Doyle, quoted a visitor to the Arctic who claimed that
he saw two distressed polar bears: “one of [the polar bears] looked to be
dead and the other one looked to be exhausted.”134 Importantly the article did
not state that the bears were actually dead or exhausted, rather that they

“looked” that way. At the time, I asked, have we really arrived at the point
where major news outlets in the United States are reduced to analyzing
whether or not polar bears in the Arctic appear to be tired? How does
reporting like this get approved for publication by the editors at Reuters?
Where was the rigorous scientific discussion?

What was missing from this Reuters news article was the fact that

according to biologists who actually study the animals for a living, polar
bears were doing quite well. Biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic
government of Nunavut, a territory of Canada, refuted these claims in May of
that year when he noted: “Of the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11
are stable or increasing in number. They are not going extinct, or even appear
to be affected at present.”135 At that stage, it was clear that it was more
interesting to hype up a polar bear catastrophe in the media than to engage in
the basic tenets of balance in journalism.

In September 2006, a report based on unproven computer models found
that polar bear populations were allegedly going to be devastated by 2050
due to global warming.136 The report was issued as part of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service’s consideration of listing the polar bear under the
Endangered Species Act. It was a classic case of reality versus speculation,
when you consider that the Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that the polar
bear population was at 20,000–25,000 bears that year, whereas in the 1950s
and 1960s, estimates were as low as 5,000–10,000 bears. That same month,
Dr. Taylor, referring to the Fish and Wildlife computer modeling report
rightly said, “It is just silly to predict the demise of polar bears in 25 years
based on media-assisted hysteria.”137

The report with unproven computer models from the Fish and Wildlife

Service, of course, was one of the key factors that led to the decision to list
the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act later in May
2008, despite the fact that actual data was showing that the number of polar
bears was not in decline.138

THE DREADED DENIERS
Why would these new outlets blatantly ignore the basic tenets of journalism,
objectivity, and balance? A reporter at the time for CBS, Scott Pelley,
provided a telling answer. According to him, excluding scientists skeptical of
global warming alarmism was justified because skeptics are the equivalent

of “Holocaust deniers.”139 Similarly, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at one of
Gore’s LIVE Earth concerts, “This is treason. And we need to start treating
them as traitors.”140 Dave Roberts of Grist openly called for Nuremberg-
style trials for climate skeptics.141

There is one particular story, however, that stands out. Heidi Cullen who,

at the time, hosted a weekly global warming program called, The Climate
Code, wrote on her blog on the Weather Channel Web site that meteorologists
should be stripped of their scientific certification if they express skepticism
about predictions of man-made catastrophic global warming. As she said:

If a meteorologist can’t speak to the fundamental science of climate
change, then maybe the AMS shouldn’t give them a Seal of Approval.
Clearly, the AMS doesn’t agree that global warming can be blamed on
cyclical weather patterns…. It’s like allowing a meteorologist to go on-
air and say that hurricanes rotate clockwise and tsunamis are caused by
the weather. It’s not a political statement…it’s just an incorrect
statement.142
With so much wrath directed at skeptics, you can imagine the names they
called me. Let’s just say that if Al Gore was a secular saint, a Noah figure,
and a prophet, I was dubbed at worst as the devil and at best as the
“Doubting Thomas,” or as the New York Times put it, the “Doubting
Inhofe.”143 In a response to that particular New York Times editorial, Debra
Saunders of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote a very clever column called
“Inhofe the Apostate,” which made much of the global warming “religious”
rhetoric:

The Times’ focus was on Inhofe’s refusal to bow to “the consensus
among mainstream scientists and the governments of nearly every
industrialized nation concerning man-made climate change.” That is,
Inhofe has had the effrontery to challenge elite orthodoxy. Or, as the
editorial put it, Inhofe “has really buttressed himself with the will to
disbelieve.”

Get thee away, Satan.

“I see a sense of desperation that I haven’t seen before,” Inhofe told

me by phone Thursday, “and frankly I’m enjoying it.”

CNN’s Miles O’Brien also challenged Inhofe in a similar vein.
O’Brien cited the NAS study, then assailed Inhofe with quotes from
notable Republicans—President Bush, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut—who recognize global warming. Note
that Schwarzenegger gets into global-warming heaven just for believing,
despite his four Hummers and use of a private jet.144

Hollywood and the mainstream media called me every name in the book:

the guy who “thinks global warming is debunked every time he drinks a
slushy and gets a brain freeze,”145 “the noisiest climate skeptic,”146 “banged
on the head too many times,”147 the “Senate’s resident denier bunny,”148
“Traitor,”149 “Dumb,” “crazy man,” “science abuser,”150 “Holocaust denier,”
“villain of the month,” “hate-filled,” “warmonger,” “Neanderthal,” “Genghis
Khan,” and “Attila the Hun.” Later in 2010, I had the distinction of being
included in Rolling Stone’s list of the “Planet’s Worst Enemies.” My only
disappointment was that I should have been No. 1, not No. 7.151

During those years, I couldn’t help but wonder: if the advocates for global

warming alarmism were so confident they had the broad consensus and the
science was settled and the evidence was overwhelming, why were they so
determined to silence me?

A MEMORABLE INTERVIEW: MILES O’BRIEN AND THE ONE-
MAN TRUTH SQUAD
The interview with CNN’s Miles O’Brien that Debra Saunders mentioned in
her column was a particularly memorable exchange that is one of the best
examples of the alarmists’ narrative that everyone was against me and I was
the only one not buying everything they were telling me.

On September 25, 2006, I gave a speech on the Senate floor called “Hot
& Cold Media Spin Cycle: A Challenge to Journalists Who Cover Global
Warming” which exposed the glaring media bias on global warming. A few
days later, on September 28, 2006, CNN ran a segment criticizing my speech
and attempting to refute the scientific evidence I presented to counter media-
hyped climate fears.152 CNN reporter Miles O’Brien inaccurately claimed

that I was “too busy” to appear on his program. They were told simply that I
was not available on Tuesday or Wednesday and that I preferred to do the
segment live.

On January 31, 2007, Miles and I finally had the chance to argue live on

national TV. Right away Miles began building up the idea that I was
completely alone amid the overwhelming “consensus.” He began with the
science:

O’BRIEN: Let’s talk about the science first. We’ve got a big report
coming out, this United Nations report, 2,500 of the world’s leading
scientists. It’s being called a smoking gun report with a link between
humans and global warming. Let’s listen to what one of the leading
scientists has to say about it.

JAMES HANSEN, DIR., GODDARD INST. FOR SPACE STUDIES:
The human link is crystal clear. There is no question, the increase from
280 to 380 parts per million in CO2 is due to the burning of fossil fuels.
O’BRIEN: That’s James Hansen, one of the leading climate scientists.
He says it’s crystal clear. What do you say?153
I said that’s James Hansen, who is paid $250,000 by the Heinz

Foundation. I told Miles he was wrong to say that the report was going to
come out that Friday. He would not be reading the actual report but the
Summary for Policymakers—the report would not surface until weeks later.
Of course, the Summary is all the media and members of Congress were ever
going to look at. They were never going to talk about anything else—and this
Summary was written by politicians, not scientists. In fact, the IPCC’s own
guidelines explicitly state that the scientific reports have to be “change[d]” to
“ensure consistency with” the politically motivated Summary for
Policymakers: “Changes (other than grammatical or minor editorial changes)
made after acceptance by the Working Group or the Panel shall be those
necessary to ensure consistency with the Summary for Policymakers or the
Overview Chapter.”154

I wasn’t alone in expressing my concerns with the UN mandating that

scientific work be altered to fit its political agenda. As Steve McIntyre, who
had debunked the hockey stick graph, said:

So the purpose of the three-month delay between the publication of the
(IPCC) Summary for Policymakers and the release of the actual WG1
(Working Group 1) is to enable them to make any ‘necessary’ adjustments
to the technical report to match the policy summary. Unbelievable. Can
you imagine what securities commissions would say if business
promoters issued a big promotion and then the promoters made the
‘necessary’ adjustments to the qualifying reports and financial statements
so that they matched the promotion.155

Harvard University Physicist Lubos Motl also slammed the UN saying,
“These people are openly declaring that they are going to commit scientific
misconduct that will be paid for by the United Nations. If they find an error in
the summary, they won’t fix it. Instead, they will ‘adjust’ the technical report
so that it looks consistent.”156

Another aspect Miles made a point of challenging me on was my religion.

As Miles correctly noted, I take my religion seriously—I always say I’m a
Jesus guy—so why wasn’t I buying into what evangelicals such as Rev.
Richard Cizik were saying? In May 2006, Vanity Fair featured a photo of
Cizik dressed like Jesus and walking on water—another savior figure in this
“religion” of global warming. Cizik was being sponsored by many
environmentalist groups who were trying to break into the National
Association of Evangelicals. Fortunately, evangelicals had already rejected
him, and for good reason. In May 2006, in a speech to the World Bank, Cizik
said, “I’d like to take on the population issue… We need to confront
population control and we can—we’re not Roman Catholics after all—but
it’s too hot to handle now.”157 So those were his true views, and he did not
represent evangelicals.

Miles wasn’t the only one who was pushing this idea that religious

leaders were buying into global warming fears. In our joint interview with
Larry King on January 31, 2007, Senator Boxer said that in addition to the
Big Oil companies that were calling her to express their support of cap and
trade, “evangelicals are coming to me. So a consensus is building and my
dear friend Jim Inhofe is just being left all alone.”158 Later on October 13,
2009, when she was announcing hearings on her own cap and trade bill, she
said, “I can report that Evangelical groups and other religious communities
have expressed their commitment to help us move the bill quickly.”159

But this was misleading: directly countering the views of Cizik and those
in the mainstream media who were pushing the idea that evangelicals were
on board with global warming hysteria, in 2000, the Cornwall Alliance
released the Cornwall Declaration which reminds us, “We should respect
creation and be wise stewards, but we must be careful not to fall into the trap
of secular environmentalists who believe that man is an afterthought on this
earth, and is principally a polluter of it.” Later in 2009, the Cornwall
Alliance’s evangelical arm issued a statement called “An Evangelical
Declaration on Global Warming,” which stated that “recent progress in
climate research suggests that:

1. Observed warming and purported dangerous effects have been
overstated.
2. Earth’s climate is less sensitive to the addition of CO2 than the alleged
scientific consensus claims it to be, which means that climate model
predictions of future warming are exaggerated.

3. Those climate changes that have occurred are consistent with natural
cycles driven by internal changes in the climate system itself, eternal
changes in solar activity, or both.160
I do not pretend to be a biblical scholar, but I have read a lot of work by

scholars on the topic of man’s relation to creation and what stewardship
means from a biblical perspective. It seems to me that we should make use of
the resources God has given us, and remember that it is God, not God’s
creation, that should be praised, as exemplified in Romans 1:25: “They gave
up the truth about God for a lie, and they worshiped God’s creation instead of
God who will be praised forever. Amen.”161

I have always greatly admired Bill Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade

for Christ, who was a close friend of mine from 1984 until his death. He
wrote a daily devotional book called Promises, which I have read nearly
every day for twenty-five years. Many times during my global warming fight,
I turned to Day 36 of Promises which features one of my favorite Bible
verses, Genesis 8:22:

As long as the earth remains

there will be springtime and harvest,

cold and heat, winter and summer,

day and night.

The devotional associated with the verse in Promises is a wonderful story

about how it is God who “maintains the seasons”:

On his way to a country church on Sunday morning, a preacher was
overtaken by one of his deacons.

“What a bitterly cold morning,” the deacon remarked. “I am sorry the
weather is so wintry.”

Smiling the minister replied, “I was just thanking God for keeping His
Word.”

“What do you mean?” the man asked with a puzzled look on his face.

“Well,” the preacher said, “more than 3,000 years ago God promised that
cold and heat should not cease, so I am strengthened by this weather
which emphasizes the sureness of His promises.”162

And this is what a lot of alarmists forget: God is still up there, and He

promised to maintain the seasons and that cold and heat would never cease
as long as the earth remains.

Miles also asked me why I remained obstinate when corporate

heavyweights were coming to Capitol Hill to testify that they could compete
in a “greenhouse gas constrained world.” As I said to Miles, if anyone thinks
these corporations are willing to reduce their emissions out of the goodness
of their hearts, think again. These companies were climate profiteers that
would gain market share against their competitors while the economy flattens
and jobs are sent to China. At that time, ten companies, ranging from Duke to
GE, announced they were joining together to create the Climate Action
Partnership, but it was abundantly clear that they would individually profit

from this plan. As I said to Miles, coal is responsible for over 50 percent of
our electricity in America. These companies have nuclear, hydroelectric,
solar, and wind, so it was to their financial advantage to do away with coal.
The biggest losers in the plan would not be big businesses, but the American
people, who would have to foot the bill for these companies’ profits under
this cap and trade regime. If I were on the board of directors of GE, who is
making solar equipment and wind turbines, I’d say, “Sure, let’s jump on this
bandwagon. We’d make a fortune.”

At the time, Republicans had begun to feel the heat of the global warming

alarmism campaign, and Miles couldn’t wait to ask me why I remained
skeptical when my Republican counterparts such as Senator John McCain
had proclaimed, “I believe climate change is real. I believe that we need to
act as quickly as possible.” But it was the State of the Union address by
President George W. Bush that was the defining moment for the media. When
President Bush said America was addicted to oil and that global warming
was a serious problem, they saw this as a victory. According to them, Bush
had caved and I was just being stubborn among my Republican colleagues
with my insistence that the science wasn’t settled. Miles also used the Bush
EPA’s Web site as further evidence:

O’BRIEN: First two lines there are, “According to the National
Academy of Sciences, the Earth’s surface temperature has risen by about
a degree Fahrenheit in the past century, with accelerated warming during
the past two decades. There is new and stronger evidence that most of the
warming over the last fifty years is attributable to human activities.” This
is the Environmental Protection Agency from the Bush administration
saying that. I mean, there is a lot of consensus here, isn’t there?163

Later in 2008, I’ll never forget the vision of Newt Gingrich sitting on a

couch in front of the Capitol holding hands with Nancy Pelosi, saying while
he and Pelosi rarely agree, “We do agree our country must take action to
address climate change,” and “If enough of us demand action from our
leaders, we can spark the innovation that we need.” Al Gore’s Alliance for
Climate Protection sponsored the ad. I applaud Newt for saying on October
9, 2011, three years after the couch episode, “That is probably the dumbest
single thing I’ve done in recent years.”164

But I told Miles that he was wrong to say that I was alone in this

particular sense: I reminded him that the last time we had a vote on cap and
trade, led by John McCain, we won 60–38. So there were fifty-nine other
senators who agreed with me on that point, even if they weren’t willing to
say it. Then I went on to explain that even if it’s true that the planet is
warming due to anthropogenic gases, if every developed nation signed on to
the Kyoto Treaty, it would only reduce the earth’s temperature by 0.06
degrees Celsius by 2050.

His reaction was very interesting: “Well, we’re not talking about Kyoto…

We’re not talking about Kyoto. We’re just talking about whether global
warming is real.”165

That last comment from Miles pretty much encapsulates the entire fear

campaign from about 2005 to 2007. It was completely centered on drumming
up terror: what they didn’t want to acknowledge was whether it was the
Kyoto Treaty or cap and trade, whatever “solution” there was to this so-
called “problem” was about as effective as demanding that every American
use only one square of toilet paper in one sitting. Indeed, cap and trade—the
greatest tax increase in American history—was actually more terrifying than
the catastrophe they were perpetrating; and for them, that was a serious
problem.

A HEATED HEARING
In December 2006, just before I had to hand the gavel of the Environment and
Public Works Committee over to the new Chairman, Senator Boxer, we held
one of my favorite hearings on how the mainstream media was over-hyping
the coverage of global warming to scare the public. One of our guests,
Paleoclimate researcher Bob Carter of Australia’s James Cook University,
who has had over one hundred papers published in revered scientific
journals, said that “there is huge uncertainly in every aspect of climate
change.” He explained:

If you look at the ice core records, you will discover that yes, changes in
carbon dioxide are accompanied by changes in temperature, but you will
also discover that the change in temperature precedes the change in
carbon dioxide by several hundred years to a thousand or so years.
Reflect on that. And reflect on when you last heard somebody say that

they thought lung cancer caused smoking. Because that is what you are
arguing if you argue on the glacial time scale that changes in carbon
dioxide cause temperature changes. It is the other way around.166

Carter also made the important point that uncertainty is even present in the

way scientists make their claims. And that was something I always found
ironic about the debate. They were always going on about how the science is
settled and there was unequivocal certainty of catastrophe, but their rhetoric,
as Carter said, was completely couched in words like “if, could, may, might,
probably, perhaps, likely, expected, projected”:

Wonderful words. So wonderful, in fact, that environmental writers
scatter them through their articles on climate change like confetti. The
reason is that—in the absence of empirical evidence for damaging
human-caused climate change—public attention is best captured by
making assertions about ‘possible’ change. And, of course, using the
output of computer models in support, virtually any type of climatic
hazard can be asserted as a possible future change.167

David Deming, a geophysicist from the University of Oklahoma, also

echoed these concerns about the media saying:

Every natural disaster that occurs is now linked [by the media] with
global warming, no matter how tenuous or impossible the connection. As
a result, the public has become vastly misinformed on this and other
environmental issues.168

I found the entire discussion compelling but I noticed there was one

person who was less than riveted. In the back of the room, there was Miles
O’Brien with his head on the press table, fast asleep.169 Oh well, I thought,
there wasn’t much hope of him converting anyway.

HUNGRY FOR THE TRUTH
The American people had been fed an unprecedented diet of hysterical
rhetoric: they were hungry for the truth. So amid the deafening noise of
Hollywood and the media, I found two powerful forums where I could
bypass the mainstream media and reach out directly to the public: talk radio

and my Environment and Public Works Committee Web site—a Web site that
launched one the first blogs and YouTube channels in Congress.

My appreciation for talk radio goes back many years. During the height of
the depression, I had a great experience that I would not fully understand for
several decades. My father worked with, and came through the depression
with, a sports announcer from WHO Radio in Des Moines by the name of
Ronald Reagan, or “Dutch Reagan” as he was called then. He was
considered family at the time and, several years later after we moved to
Tulsa, we thought of him differently as he became an important political
figure. I was a small child at the time and my father worked most every day
of the week. We rarely went to movies, but whenever there was a Dutch
Reagan movie, we would go without fail. I recall one night driving six hours
round trip to Duncan, Oklahoma, just to see a Dutch Reagan movie.

From watching Reagan throughout his career, I learned about the power of

talk radio to reach a wide audience—I knew it would be one of the best
ways to get my message about global warming far and wide. Whether through
the Steve Malzberg show in New York City or the Steve Hennen show in
North Dakota, I have appreciated all the opportunities to subvert the
mainstream media. Now with Twitter and Facebook, it has been easy to alert
people across the country whenever I’m going to speak on a local Oklahoma
radio show.

Now there is also a large global warming community online that offers
diverse perspectives on the ongoing debate. There are several top skeptic
sites that I recommend, but to name a few I would suggest R.A. Pielke Sr.,
Colorado State Climatologist Emeritus and Senior Research Scientist CIRES
University of Colorado at Boulder (http://pielkeclimatesci.word-press.com),
his son Roger Pielke Jr., professor of environmental studies at the Center for
Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado at
Boulder (http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com), Judith Curry, Professor and
Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia
Institute of Technology and President (co-owner) of Climate Forecast
Applications Network (CFAN) (http://judithcurry.com), Steve McIntyre
(ClimateAudit.org), Steve Malloy (JunkScience.com), and Anthony Watts
(WattsUpWithThat.com). For one-stop shopping of the best headlines of the
day, my former committee staffer Marc Morano runs the site
www.climatedepot.com. While these sites do not necessarily represent my

views, I think they are wonderful vehicles that show the aggressive ongoing
debate about climate science.

Of course, one of the most effective vehicles for the truth was my

committee website where people could hear the viewpoints that had been
silenced so long in the mainstream. My approach to an online presence was
based largely on the principles put forward by conservative radio host Hugh
Hewitt in his book Blog published in 2005. I know it seems strange today to
think that my Web site, which featured a blog addressing global warming,
was innovative, but at that time, not many of my colleagues on Capitol Hill
were blogging, so it was actually quite a new thing. An article in the Wall
Street Journal put it well:

Pundits do it. Scientists do it. Even Donald Trump does it. So why
shouldn’t Congress blog too?

As the former Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works

Committee, Republican Jim Inhofe was a coruscating critic of climate
change alarmism. Now in the minority, he plans to make sure his voice is
heard over the din of the media-savvy environmental groups through a
new blog […] And their new blog is already making waves, not to
mention causing some congressional tech malfunctioning.170

The technical malfunctioning mentioned in the Wall Street Journal article
was due to one particular blog post where we called out Heidi Cullen of the
Weather Channel for saying that meteorologists who did not believe in global
warming should be stripped of their scientific certification. The Drudge
Report subsequently linked to that post, and the response was so
overwhelming that the entire Senate web system crashed, including all my
colleagues’ personal pages and committee pages.

The Hill newspaper quoted an email sent to the Senate offices by the

Sergeant at Arms that day which read, “Drudgereport.com established a link
on their Web site to a press release on a Senate committee Web site. This link
was creating 30–50,000 queries per hour to Senate.gov, which in turn was
generating a query to the Press Application for each of those hits.”171

That was not the only time Drudge linked to our blog. It also picked up my

speech on the Senate floor about the hot-and-cold media spin cycle in
September 2006, which created a firestorm of support pouring into my office.

My committee staff, at the time, was overwhelmed by the phone ringing off
the hook from people across America, thanking us for having a refreshing
voice of reason amid so much hysteria.

In thousands of emails and phone calls, Americans expressed not only
their thanks but also their frustration with the major media outlets because
they knew in their gut that what they had been hearing was false and
misleading. Here’s a brief sampling of what people were saying:

Janet of Saugus, Massachusetts: “Thank you Senator Inhofe. Finally

someone with the guts to stand up and call it what it is—a sham. I think you
have taken over Toby Keith’s place as my favorite Oklahoman!!”

Al of Clinton, Connecticut, wrote: “It’s about time someone with a loud
microphone spoke up on the global warming scam. You have courage—if
only this message could get into the schools where kids are being brow-
beaten with the fear message almost daily.”

Kevin of Jacksonville, Florida, wrote: “I’m so glad that we have leaders
like you who are willing to stand up against the onslaught of liberal media,
Hollywood and the foolish elected officials on this topic. Please keep up the
fight!”

Steven of Phoenix, Arizona, wrote: “As a scientist, I am extremely

pleased to see that there is at least one member of congress who recognizes
the global warming hysteria for what it is. I am extremely impressed by the
Senator’s summary and wish he were running for President.”

Craig of Grand Rapids, Michigan, wrote: “As a meteorologist I strongly

agree with everything you said.”

Dan of Westwood, Massachusetts, wrote: “This is the most concise, well

researched, eloquently presented argument against Global Warming I have
ever seen. Somebody in Congress has finally gotten it right!”

Adam of Salmon, Idaho, wrote: “Thank you for the brave speech made all
about the hyping about alleged global warming and its causes. It took guts.”

Once launched, the Inhofe Environment and Public Works Committee

Press Blog quickly developed into a watchdog on news media excesses; it
provided the badly needed balance that was lacking in mainstream
environmental reporting. In 2007, I was honored to receive the Gold Mouse
Award for having one of the best Web sites on Capitol Hill. The Gold Mouse
Report and Awards were part of the “Connecting to Congress” research
project, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. For this

project CMF, partnered with researchers from the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, University of California-Riverside, and
Ohio State University to study how Members of Congress can use the Internet
to improve communications with their constituents and to promote greater
participation in the legislative process.

Later, in 2009, even liberal bloggers admitted that my Web site wasn’t too

bad. As Jonathan Hiskes of Grist wrote,

Listen up, James Inhofe, because this might be the only compliment Grist
ever pays you: You’ve got a decent website. Despite your wackedout
view that climate change is a “hoax” and your opposition to a climate
bill, inhofe.senate.gov does a fair job of making your climate and energy
positions clear and accessible to the Oklahomans who voted to send you
to Washington. In fact, your website is more transparent than the sites of
many senators who completely disagree with your views on global
warming, including Democratic leaders Harry Reid (Nev.) and Richard
Durbin (Ill.), along with two of the most influential senators when it
comes to environmental policymaking—Barbara Boxer (Calif.) and Jeff
Bingaman (N.M.).172

One of the best aspects of our Web site (and one of the reasons we won

the Gold Mouse award) is that we had dueling headlines on the Environment
and Public Works homepage between the minority and the majority, which
clearly showed that there was a strong debate on global warming. Of course,
we were far more active than Senator Boxer’s staff and the impact of our
Web site would eventually become too much for her. She unfortunately
decided to eliminate the dueling headlines and told my staff we could only
post on the minority Web site, not on the homepage.

The day we shut down the Senate web system because of the Drudge link

was in January 2007. To me it was an auspicious beginning to a year that,
from the outside, looked as though it was going to be bad for skeptics.
Democrats had taken back the Senate after the 2006 elections. I had just
handed over the gavel to the new Chairman, Senator Barbara Boxer, after
losing our majority. Of course, Chairman Boxer was a strong global warming
advocate who promised in the early days of her Chairmanship that cap and
trade was going to pass.

I may have given up the gavel, but as the Drudge incidents revealed, I

knew that I had the ear of the American people, and they were hungry for the
truth. As Winston Churchill said, “Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may resent
it. Ignorance may deride it. Malice may destroy it, but there it is.”

In many ways, the crash of the Senate Web site was a metaphor for what
our message of the truth was capable of doing: exposing the global warming
cap and trade hoax for what it was, and subsequently letting it all come
crashing down.

4

SKEPTICISM REIGNS

IFAL GORE WAS RIGHT about one thing in 2007, it was his claim that global
warming had reached a tipping point—but it was tipping in my direction, not
his. In October 2007, I stood on the Senate floor and said that “future climate
historians will look back at 2007, as the year global warming fears began
crumbling”—and I was right.

HOLLYWOOD HYPOCRISY: GORE REFUSES TO TAKE THE
PLEDGE
One of the greatest ironies of the global warming movement is that Al Gore
and the Hollywood elite, who were so successful in launching the issue into
the spotlight, were the very ones who ended up sealing their own campaign’s
doom with the American people.

They were their own worst enemies. Here they were, screaming about
climate catastrophe and demanding that Americans use only one square of
toilet paper, take cold showers or two-minute showers, not eat meat, and take
public transportation, while clearly they were not willing to make these
sacrifices themselves. In those years, it was not the science that was
overwhelming but rather the hypocrisy of those who were emitting so much
more carbon than the average American with their multiple mansions and
private jets, telling everyone else that they had to cut back.

I wasn’t going to let them get away with it. I said repeatedly that Al Gore
and his Hollywood friends were happy to talk the talk but refused to walk the
walk. How hard is it for these elitists to become as frugal in their energy
consumption as the average American? Apparently it was impossible. They
could have their limos and their private jets, but everyone else had to suffer.
The American public knew they were being had.

One of the most humorous examples of this came when Al Gore and

Leonardo DiCaprio teamed up to have their message “Ride mass transit”
flashed on the TV screen during the 2007 Academy Awards. As Charles
Krauthammer succinctly put it, “This to a conclave of Hollywood plutocrats
who have not seen the inside of a subway since the moon landing and for
whom mass transit means a stretch limo seating no fewer than ten.”173
Although I have to give some credit to global warming advocate John
Travolta, who finally admitted, “I’m probably not the best candidate to ask
about global warming because I fly jets.”174

If John Travolta wasn’t the best candidate, Gore was the worst of all. He

went around saying things like: the world must embrace a “carbonneutral
lifestyle”175 and we have just “ten years to avert a major catastrophe that
could send our entire planet into a tailspin” while having a house that
consumes more electricity every month than the average American household
uses in an entire year.176 And this is not to mention the multiple trips he takes
on multiple carbon-emitting private jets. No, flying commercial would not
do.

So Al Gore, one of the biggest carbon emitters in the world, was chosen
to be the face of the campaign to eliminate carbon from our lives. This was a
recipe for failure.

At the end of An Inconvenient Truth, the last message flashed on the

screen is a challenge to America and the world: “Are you ready to change the
way you live?” So I said, yes, Al Gore, are you ready to change the way you
live? When Gore came to testify at an Environment and Public Works
Committee hearing in March 2007, I asked him if he would be willing to sign
a pledge—frankly, of his own making—that as a believer in catastrophic
man-made global warming, would he consume no more energy at his
residence than the average American household by March 21, 2008?177 I
even gave him a year to do it!

Of course, during the hearing he wouldn’t answer the question and

waffled around the issue, going on as he always does about how we need to
transition to a clean energy future. So I said I’d be anxious to hear his answer
in the questions for the record. Here’s what I received months later:

Inhofe: As a believer that human-caused global warming is a moral,
ethical, and spiritual issue affecting our survival; that home energy use is
a key component of overall energy use; that reducing my fossil fuel-based
home energy usage will lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions; and that
leaders on moral issues should lead by example; I pledge to consume no
more energy for use in my residence than the average American
household by March 21, 2008.

Given that hundreds of Americans—a great many of whom could not

afford offsets—would follow your example by significantly reducing
their home energy consumption, will you now agree to take the pledge?

Gore: No.

DESPERATION IN THE ALARMISTS CAMPS
As one can imagine, this particular hearing caused quite a stir in the media,
with every global warming reporter weighing in. The most memorable recap
was aired on Keith Olbermann’s show. He invited journalist Howard
Fineman, who at the time was with Newsweek and now is a senior editor at
the Huffington Post, to discuss what he called “the link between Inhofe and
the smear campaign against Gore,” which was, according to Olbermann,

“venomous.”178 Their evidence was that my communications director at the
time, who had once worked for Rush Limbaugh, was handing out our press
release of the day, which called out Gore for his refusal to take our energy
pledge. As Fineman said about my so-called “smear campaign”:

Well it is extensive. The guy you were talking about was buzzing around
the press table I was sitting at, handing around press releases before,
during, and after the Vice President’s appearance. I think there’s a few
things going on here. For one, Al Gore is winning this argument,
scientifically and politically.179

My staffer was not doing anything out of the ordinary: press staff always

distribute releases and opening statements to members of the press during
hearings. It is standard operating procedure. The real problem here was that I
was drawing national attention to one of the movement’s greatest weaknesses
—its hypocrisy—so they were going overboard to compensate, practically
shouting that I was losing and Gore was winning:

FINEMAN: If Inhofe is the best arguer they can come up with for their
side Al Gore is in even better shape politically than he even realizes.

OLBERMAN: Yeah we have a great chance of saving the planet then.
Mr. Inhofe is putting the fossil back in fossil fuels.180

As for Gore, Fineman called him the “‘Goricle.’ He’s the guy everyone’s
listening to. He’s got his answers down pat on all this thing. He goes around
being a sage. He doesn’t have to run for anything. He’s the unofficial
president of the environment now.”181

Talk about “global governance.” Their only problem was that it wasn’t
true: 2007 was the tipping point—the Great Goricle’s prophesies of doom
were wearing thin with the American people and they were coming over to
my side in droves.

In the summer of 2007, Gore launched his “Live Earth” Concerts, which

were held across the world—including Washington, D.C., New York,
Sydney, Shanghai, and Rio de Janeiro. These performances featured “more
than 150 of the world’s best music acts—a mix of both legendary music acts
like The Police, Genesis, Bon Jovi and Madonna with the latest headliners

like Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, Black Eyed Peas and Jack Johnson.” The
mission, according to the Web site, was to have twenty-four hours of music
performed on seven continents in order to instill “a worldwide call to action
and the solutions necessary to answer that call. Live Earth launched a multi-
year campaign to drive individuals, corporations and governments to take
action to solve the climate crisis.”

But as MTV put it, the “results were mixed.”182 For one thing, the first

snowfall in years and extremely cold temperatures were blamed for the poor
turnout in Johannesburg. A Rasmussen poll published on July 8, 2007,
showed that “most Americans tuned out.” Only twenty-two percent of
Americans even followed the concerts somewhat or very closely while
seventy-five percent did not follow coverage of the event.183 To add insult to
injury, after all the time and money spent on their campaign, only twelve
percent of Americans said that global warming was the most important issue
to them.

Further, Rasmussen found that some of the biggest carbon emitters in the
world telling everyone else to cut back wasn’t really working out for them:

Skepticism about the participants may have been a factor in creating this
low level of interest. Most Americans (52%) believe the performers take
part in such events because it is good for their image. Only 24% say the
celebrities really believe in the cause while another 24% are not sure.
One rock star who apparently shared that view is Matt Bellamy of the
band Muse. Earlier in the week, he jokingly referred to Live Earth as
“private jets for climate change.”184

Americans were clearly on to them for their hypocrisy, which continued to
be a persistent problem for the Live Earth campaign: for instance, Madonna,
who was a key performer in these climate concerts, had just made a name for
herself as one of the world’s worst polluters. Having already offered the
pledge to Gore, I thought why not extend it to other eco-hypocritical
celebrities as well? In April 2007, in the spirit of Earth Day, I challenged
global warming activists/celebrities such as Laurie David, John Travolta,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Madonna to do what former Vice President Al Gore
refused to do—live up to their environmental rhetoric by reducing their home

energy usage to the level of the average American household by Earth Day
2008.185

I thought it was the least they could do since they were so worried that

mankind only had ten years left to act in order to avoid a climate catastrophe,
and they had made personal energy use a cornerstone of their pleas to the
general public to save the planet. I have yet to get one of them to sign my
pledge.

THOSE PESKY BLIZZARDS: GLOBAL WARMING OR CLIMATE
CHANGE?
The alarmists also had another serious problem: the weather didn’t always
cooperate with their predictions of tropical doom—they didn’t know what to
say when it turned cold. With a dire future in store of melting ice caps,
drowning polar bears, and rising sea levels, Al Gore and the media had built
up such a strong narrative that global warming was leading to higher
temperatures, any cold spell threw them for a loop. Keith Olbermann’s clip
on Gore’s visit to Capitol Hill provides a good example of the kind of
rhetoric that was always getting them into trouble:

OLBERMAN: What’s Inhofe’s story? …Does he explain the oil
companies who are funding some of the garbage science that says oh no
everything’s great. Don’t anybody panic. That sweat on your brow in the
middle of February has nothing to do with global warming.186

But the problem was that places across America were not experiencing

sweat on their brows in the middle of February but, instead, record cold
temperatures—and that was kind of inconvenient for them. At the March
2007 hearing, I challenged Gore on that point. He had mentioned that the fires
that were occurring in Oklahoma that year were due to global warming. So I
asked him, “How come you guys never seem to notice it when it gets
cold?”187 I held up a document from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration that showed that there were 183 record cold temperatures in
January 2007—183 of them! As for Oklahoma, we had three days that year
that were the coldest days in history. So I asked: where is global warming
when you really need it?

That was a question that continued to haunt the movement. Their heated

rhetoric failed every time the snow fell: they needed to modify it to
accommodate those inconvenient blizzards and record cold temperatures. Al
Gore later went on to claim that heavy snowfalls are completely consistent
with man-made catastrophic global warming, saying in a February 27, 2010
New York Times op-ed, “Just as it’s important not to miss the forest for the
trees, neither should we miss the climate for the snowstorm.” The American
people were suspicious to say the least, especially when they noticed a
deliberate shift in terms over this period from catastrophic “global warming”
to “climate change.”188

AL GORE’S NEW HOME
“Snowmageddon”—the intense blizzard that shut down Washington, D.C., for
weeks in February 2010 was what really spurred a crisis of messaging in the
global warming camps.

Because of the blizzard, the airport was closed, all the federal buildings
were closed, and very few people were even leaving their houses. Just days
before the storm struck, my daughter Molly and her family arrived in
Washington for an annual event that I sponsor called the African Dinner. This
year was special because my beautiful granddaughter Zegita Marie was
going to speak at the dinner. You see, we found Zegita in Ethiopia as a baby
—she had been left an orphan. Molly and her husband already had three boys
and always wanted a girl. They instantly loved Zegita Marie, as we all did,
and decided to adopt her.

My daughter Molly’s family at the igloo

God may have been having a little fun with the alarmists that week too: the

scheduled Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on “Global
Warming Impacts, Including Public Health, in the United States” had to be
postponed because the blizzard had essentially shut the government down. Of
course, the logic of the alarmists was that the global warming hearing was
cancelled due to a blizzard that was caused by global warming. Senator John
Kerry reminded us that we were still facing the grave threat of global
warming and that the “solution” was still on the horizon: as he said in an
article for The Hill, “those who think climate change legislation is dead for
the year are ‘dead wrong.’ Those who think blizzards and record snow falls
in Washington will make it tough to move a global warming bill are guilty of
‘inside the beltway’ thinking.”189

Molly and her husband and kids decided to make the most of the snow and
built an elaborate igloo right outside the Library of Congress—you could put
four people in there. Then they put on the finishing touch: a sign that read,
“Al Gore’s New Home—Honk if you love global warming.” So as you can
see, skepticism runs in our family.

They sent me a picture and I thought it was so clever I put it up on my

Facebook page right away. The media blizzard that ensued was really
remarkable. But of all the press, Keith Olbermann, who had just a few years
earlier said we’d be wiping sweat off our brow in the middle of February,
was the one who took it the hardest. He featured Molly’s family on his show
that night as “The Worst Family in America.” I guess some people just can’t
take a joke.

I’m a public figure, an elected official, and being a target is part of the
job. It’s quite another thing for my family to be subjected to ridicule and
vicious name-calling. But I’ll let my daughter Molly speak to that:

How An Afternoon of Family Fun Ended Up in Global Warming
Headlines
—By Molly Inhofe Rapert, daughter of U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe

It’s hard to imagine that choosing to spend a family afternoon in the
outdoors together could result in a polarizing political event, but that’s
exactly what happened in February of 2010. It all began with a special
trip to Washington, D.C. to watch our youngest child, Marie, speak at an
African event associated with the 2010 National Prayer Breakfast. Our
family of six lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas and includes my husband,
Jimmy, and our children, Jase, Luke, Jonah, and Zegita Marie. At the time
of this event, the kids were 14, 12, 11, and 9. Marie was born in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2001 and beautifully spoke of her adoption journey,
and love for Africa, on Thursday evening, February 6.

The weather took a turn for the worse that evening and, by Friday

morning, had developed into a record-breaking snowstorm. My husband,
Jimmy, always finds great things for our family to do outdoors—hiking,
camping, and more. So he saw this as the perfect opportunity to spend an
afternoon outside, building an igloo near the Library of Congress. Five
hours later, an impressive six-foot igloo had emerged with Capitol Hill
as the backdrop.

Our oldest son, Jase, added a touch of humor with a sign reading “Al

Gore’s New Home” with the flip side: “Honk if You Love Global
Warming.” Jase had completed two science fair projects that examined

the media perceptions of global warming/cooling and the projects just
sparked a natural connection to the irony of being in Washington, D.C. in
a historic storm, steps away from where Vice-President Gore had
worked on his book, An Inconvenient Truth.

Jase’s sign went up on top of the igloo, car horns honked, and folks

stopped to have their photo taken. It all seemed harmless enough—
actually, not just harmless…I’ll admit that, as parents, we were proud
that we had managed to get our kids out of the house, spending 5 hours
playing outside together on a very cold day.

Washington, D.C. was virtually shut down, the Smithsonians were

closed, we were simply making the best out of the situation at hand. We
enjoyed visiting with people as they stopped to look at the igloo, and
everyone that stopped was light-hearted and happy, whether they
believed in man-made global warming or not. It was a great day.

We call my dad PopI (short for Pop-Inhofe). PopI loaded the photo of
the igloo on his Facebook page, where it was picked up by Roll Call then
Heard on the Hill. From there, the photo snowballed with the same
ferocity of the snowstorm. The initial coverage adopted the same tone as
the kind-hearted people that had stopped to talk to us on the street—it
was a funny quip and everyone understood that it was simply a family
outing on a snowy day, with no intense political agenda intended. We
headed back to Fayetteville, with great memories of our snowy trip to
Washington, D.C. Then Keith Olbermann entered our lives.

A common end-of-show segment on the Olbermann show is to identify
the worst person in the world. That Sunday evening, Mr. Olbermann, in a
bizarre twist, far removed from what anyone could deem true journalism,
decided to name our family one of his worst families in the world for
making a joke about climate change “in a storm that killed people.”
Actually no one was killed by the storm in Washington, D.C., but that’s
only one of the many journalistic flaws he commits on a regular basis. He
didn’t even bother to pronounce our names correctly.

We did not see his show when it aired. Our wonderful pediatrician, a
staunch conservative who watches Olbermann to “see what the enemy is

saying,” texted us at midnight to say she had never been so appalled and
that we had to watch it. After viewing it together, Jimmy and I knew we
needed to show it to the kids before they went to school, in case any of
their friends had seen it.

We gathered around our kitchen table. The look on the younger kids’
faces was hard to watch. How confusing this must have been to them—
we had worked hard to teach them to respect authority and to encourage
them to watch the news, learn about the world around them. For them to
see an adult speaking about their family in such an aggressive, abrupt,
highly inappropriate way was insulting. Their faces revealed their
confusion.

You can imagine that, from their point of view, they had spent a day in
the snow building an igloo—no political agenda, no political discussion.
Just a lot of good, old-fashioned work making lots and lots of blocks of
snow. They couldn’t quite equate their igloo experience with the man on
the computer screen ranting and raving about them by name. To say they
were “taken aback” perhaps describes it best. We tried our best to use it
as an opportunity to explain the importance of always conveying the truth
of a situation, illustrating how Mr. Olbermann had used the situation out
of context to further his own agenda. We explained that they had done
nothing wrong; it was a lighthearted day that someone else was
attempting to use to his advantage. Our oldest son, Jase, lightened up the
situation when he said “Worst family in the world? From Olbermann? I
wear that as a badge of honor.”

Olbermann’s show sparked remarkable controversy in the media. We
were shocked with the intensity of the comments on the Internet as well
as the language that was used. Some bloggers harshly criticized us,
saying that we asked for this by mocking the vice-president. I would
argue two things. First, many people make light-hearted jokes about
global warming whenever the weather turns cold…we simply put it on
paper. We didn’t shout it from the mountaintops, we didn’t set out with a
political agenda, we just made an igloo for fun and then put the sign up as
a minor afterthought at the end of an enjoyable day. Second, I don’t know
of any reasonable human being who could possibly equate a sign made by

a fourteen-year-old with the vitriol of Keith Olbermann—an adult who
chose to identify a family on national television in a diatribe. How
Olbermann and his staff could look at a photo of four young children
having fun outdoors and, with malice, go after them in an attempt to
elevate themselves—it is hard for me to fathom.

Others were not amused with Olbermann’s attack. Rush Limbaugh and
Sean Hannity both aired segments commenting on the igloo situation and
commending our family for building it. Blogger Amy Ridenour levied a
harsh criticism at Olbermann’s sponsor, stating “GE should be ashamed
of itself for allowing its personnel to attack children on air. These kids
probably are sophisticated enough to realize Olbermann’s just doing it
for attention, but it’s still pathetic to see a giant corporation going after
kids.” Individual bloggers rallied to our defense, hammering both
Olbermann and the bloggers who had joined his side. But the energy
gathered on both ends of the spectrum. One of my personal favorites
came from blogger, They Gave Us a Republic, who stated on his website
that I suffered from “congenital, multigenerational stupidity.” The
Progressive Electorate blog claimed that PopI had “used” his
grandchildren to make a political point, making us build an igloo which
mocked a snowstorm that killed people. Fortunately, this level of
stupidity didn’t need to be defended as most Americans recognize that
you don’t need to force kids to play in the snow—although perhaps that
blogger had a childhood where he preferred to sit in front of a computer
rather than play outside? Oh yes, and Grant Lawrence’s blogsite called
our children “mentally handicapped” spawns who are academically
inferior to a damp sponge. The poor fellow would be so disappointed to
learn that our kids are actually all honor roll students. The wonderful
blog, Maggie’s Notebook, jumped to our defense, pointing out the
absurdity of these and other statements.

By the end of the week, the igloo story had been picked up by a

variety of news sources including: ABC Nightly News, CNN, Fox News,
Good Morning America, Neil Cavuto Business, The Washington Post,
New York Times, CBN, CBS, CNS, NBC, Newsmax, Rush Limbaugh,
Sean Hannity, and Wall Street Journal.

I’ll admit that as a marketing professor, if I ever hoped to be quoted in
the Wall Street Journal, I never expected it to be for an igloo! Here is a
sampling of the headlines from the various blogs and internet sources,
illustrating the extreme takes on the story:

• Inhofe’s grandchildren build igloo to mock killer snowstorm190

• Jim Inhofe, America’s Worse Senator, also has America’s Worse

Grandchildren191

• Olbermann names Inhofe family worst person in the world

• GOP Sen Inhofe’s global warming denial a family affair

• Global warming denier Sen. James Inhofe’s family builds a very

special igloo for Al Gore

• Inhofe’s Al Gore Igloo

• Inhofe family talks about igloo, national media coverage

• Inhofe family mocks Al Gore’s global warming

• Al Gore’s new house on Capitol Hill

• Global warming snow job

• Family’s igloo draws debate over warming

• Olbermann Inhofe family worst family in world: igloo frosts critics

• 14-year-old Jase Rapert tells off Olbermann

• Inhofe igloo frosts critics

• DC igloo takes aim at global warming

• UA professor’s ice storm story continues to snowball

• Al Gore’s new home don’t you dare

• Family in hot seat for global warming joke

As Tina Korbe stated in an article written for the University of

Arkansas Traveler, “It’s difficult to say which was bigger: the historic
ice storm that prompted UA marketing professor Molly Rapert and her
family to build an igloo on Capitol Hill—or the media blizzard the igloo
inspired.”192 This was an interesting lesson for our family, even more
relevant to society today as we watch how quickly internet sources and
pundits will jump on a story and stretch it beyond the limits of the
original situation. On one hand, it is inspiring that so many people care
about issues and want to be involved. Whether they ardently believe that
government intervention is needed to help protect the earth—or whether
they believe the earth is naturally moving through warming and cooling
cycles and that it is foolhardy to pursue government-based initiatives. On
the other hand, it is disheartening to witness the willingness of people to
publicly express such extreme, intense opinions that are not fact-based.
We were grateful for bloggers, such as Amy Ridenour and Maggie’s
Notebook, who were willing to use their blog forums to counter
comments that stepped beyond the bounds of decency.

An enjoyable family afternoon together; a five-hour-in-the-making six-
foot igloo; and a funny quip that captured the sentiments of many make up
the great igloo saga of 2010. If that makes us the worst family in the
world, I’ll join Jase and wear that badge with honor.

Olbermann, by the way, left the network not long after that.
My daughter Molly is a brilliant marketing professor with a PhD from the

University of Memphis. She received the 2010 Hormel Master Marketing
Teacher Award and was an Inaugural Recipient of the 2011 University of
Arkansas Honors College Distinguished Faculty Award. She is also the
recipient of the Beta Gamma Sigma Outstanding Teaching Award (2007), the
Sam M. Walton College of Business Excellence in Service Award (2006 and
1993), the Arkansas Alumni Association Distinguished Faculty Achievement
in Teaching Award (2002), the Walton College of Business Excellence in

Teaching Award (2001 and 1998), and the Walton College Excellence in
Advising Award (1996).

To my great surprise, one member of the liberal establishment media,
Dana Milbank of The Washington Post—one who had his own fun at my
expense several times—understood the significance of the igloo for his
side’s argument. As he wrote:

Still, there’s some rough justice in the conservatives’ cheap shots. In
Washington’s blizzards, the greens were hoist by their own petard. For
years, climate-change activists have argued by anecdote to make their
case. Gore, in his famous slide shows, ties human-caused global
warming to increasing hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, drought and the
spread of mosquitoes, pine beetles and disease. It’s not that Gore is
wrong about these things. The problem is that his storm stories have
conditioned people to expect an endless worldwide heat wave, when in
fact the changes so far are subtle. Other environmentalists have
undermined the cause with claims bordering on the outlandish; they’ve
blamed global warming for shrinking sheep in Scotland, more shark and
cougar attacks, genetic changes in squirrels, an increase in kidney stones
and even the crash of Air France Flight 447. When climate activists make
the dubious claim, as a Canadian environmental group did, that global
warming is to blame for the lack of snow at the Winter Olympics in
Vancouver, then they invite similarly specious conclusions about
Washington’s snow—such as the Virginia GOP ad urging people to call
two Democratic congressmen “and tell them how much global warming
you get this weekend.” Argument-by-anecdote isn’t working. Consider
the words of Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the energy
committee, who told The Hill newspaper last week that the snow “makes
it more challenging” to make the case about global warming’s danger to
people who aren’t “taking time to review the scientific arguments.”193

So he was saying that my family had a point. Alarmists were always going
on about how the overheating planet is causing every weather disaster known
to mankind, but there was always a crisis of messaging when it came to
extremely cold temperatures. Milbank concluded his column writing, “If the
Washington snows persuade the greens to put away the slides of polar bears

and pine beetles and to keep the focus on national security and jobs, it will
have been worth the shoveling.”194

ABC NEWS: EGG ON THEIR FACE
Not everyone in the media received Milbank’s memo about not using weather
to justify global warming policy.

It was a very hot summer day in July 2010 when Jon Karl with ABC News
approached my office to ask if I would give an interview on the prospects of
global warming policy—outside in the heat. Their intentions were obvious,
so my staff asked me if I wanted to do it. Of course I did—I enjoy ambushes
—so we headed outside, ready to turn the tables on them.195

Sure enough, instead of the usual one cameraman and one reporter, there

was a large production crew set up, and a crowd had gathered outside to
watch, so I knew they were planning to do something big. Karl began with
questions on the prospects of cap and trade but then shifted quickly to what
he really wanted to ask me about: the weather. It was so predictable. “How’s
that igloo doing now?” he asked. Here we go again.

Then Karl had brought out his incontrovertible proof that global warming

was happening: a pan with an egg in it. They thought it was so hot outside
that the egg would fry—only it didn’t. After the botched ambush, the crew
tossed the egg out on to the grass. When my communications director started
to take pictures of the unfried proof of global warming, the ABC news crew
came sprinting back to clear the evidence. The crowd that had gathered was
given quite a show, but not the one they expected.

THE “CONSENSUS” BEGINS TO COLLAPSE
In March 2007, the IPCC fourth assessment boldly declared that man’s
contribution to global warming was “unequivocal,” Hollywood and the
mainstream media had been peddling the scientific “consensus” with a
vengeance, and yet, a Los Angeles Times/ Bloomberg poll in August 2006
found that most Americans did not attribute the cause of any recent severe
weather events to global warming, and the portion of Americans who
believed that climate change is due to natural variability has increased over
50 percent in the last five years. After all that money and effort, this must
have been quite a blow.196

If Hollywood hypocrisy had cooled the public’s reception to the

alarmists, their excessive hysteria, which inflated the issue beyond their
wildest dreams, was exactly what propelled so many scientists, even those
from the left wing, to come forward in dissent. Scientists began to feel that
their work was being pushed to the side while activists made the most
outlandish claims; many became increasingly uncomfortable with the
alarmists’ aggressive agenda. As a result, several key scientists made the
“conversion” from a believer to a skeptic.

The biggest shock to the global warming camp was probably the

conversion of Dr. Claude Allegre—a renowned French geophysicist, a
former French Socialist Party leader, a member of both the French and U.S.
Academies of Science, and one of the first scientists to sound the global
warming alarm—who changed around 2006 from being a believer to a
skeptic. This was a guy who marched up and down the street twenty years
ago saying man-made gases are going to bring the world to an end. Now he
was saying that the cause of climate change is unknown and even accused the
climate alarmists of being motivated by money. In a September 2006 article,
he said, “The ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative
business for some people!”197 I thought that it was so ironic that a free market
conservative capitalist in the U.S. Senate and a French Socialist scientist
were both saying that sound science is not what is driving this debate, but
greed by those who would use this issue to line their own pockets.

Allegre was not the only prominent scientist to convert. Astrophysicist Dr.
Nir Shaviv, a sharp young astrophysicist from Israel, also recanted his belief
that man-made emissions were driving climate change, and said that solar
activity can explain a large part of warming in the twentieth century. As he
said in a February 2, 2007, Canadian National Post article:

Like many others, I was personally sure that CO2 is the bad culprit in the
story of global warming. But after carefully digging into the evidence, I
realized that things are far more complicated than the story sold to us by
many climate scientists or the stories regurgitated by the media. In fact,
there is much more than meets the eye.198

Botanist Dr. David Bellamy, a famed UK environmental campaigner,

former lecturer at Durham University, and host of a popular UK TV series on
wildlife, also converted into a skeptic after reviewing the science. Bellamy

said that “global warming is largely a natural phenomenon” and said that
catastrophic fears were “poppycock.” “The world is wasting stupendous
amounts of money on trying to fix something that can’t be fixed,” and
“climate-change people have no proof for their claims. They have computer
models which do not prove anything.”199 Bellamy paid a steep price for his
conversion: he was derided by many environmental groups, and they severed
their ties with him despite his long record of environmental activism, which
included being arrested while trying to prevent loggers from cutting down a
rainforest in Tasmania, saving peat bogs, and other endangered habitats.
Finally, meteorologist Dr. Reid Bryson, the founding chairman of the

Department of Meteorology at the University of Wisconsin (now the
Department of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences), who was a key figure
promoting the ice age scare of the 1970s, also converted into a leading
global warming skeptic. In a May 2007 issue of Wisconsin Energy
Cooperative News, he said,

Before there were enough people to make any difference at all, two
million years ago, nobody was changing the climate, yet the climate was
changing, okay? All this argument is the temperature going up or not, it’s
absurd. Of course it’s going up. It has gone up since the early 1800s,
before the Industrial Revolution, because we’re coming out of the Little
Ice Age, not because we’re putting more carbon dioxide into the air.200

Another remarkable thing happened just a year before. On April 11, 2006,

sixty prominent scientists, many of whom advised the Canadian Prime
Minister in the 1990s to ratify Kyoto, wrote in an open letter to Prime
Minister Stephen Harper saying,

Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto]
protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern
about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew
what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not
exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary.201

Also important was that the Czech President Vaclav Klaus said on

February 8, 2007, that fears of catastrophic man-made global warming were
a “myth” and critiqued the UN IPCC process, calling it a “political body.”

He also remarkably said that other government leaders would also speak out
if it were not for the fact that “political correctness strangles their voice.”202

While major media news outlets continued to ignore the prominent
scientists and leaders such as Allegre, Shaviv, Bellamy, Bryson, Czech
President Klaus, and the sixty Canadian scientists who were becoming
increasingly skeptical, I noticed that smaller news outlets across the country
were actually doing their job and providing balanced coverage of global
warming, and in the process, they were uncovering hundreds of skeptical
scientists.

Award-winning Chief Meteorologist James Spann of an Alabama ABC
TV affiliate, who holds the highest level of certification from the American
Meteorological Society, wrote in a January 18, 2007, blog post: “I do not
know of a single TV meteorologist who buys into the man-made global
warming hype. I know there must be a few out there, but I can’t find them.”203
This fascinated me, so I asked my staff to begin watching for and compiling
news clips that mention scientists who disputed man-made global warming
catastrophe. James Spann has the distinction of being the first skeptic
scientist to be included in a list that grew to over 450 in 2007; it reached 750
by 2009, and today my former communications director, Marc Morano, keeps
the list up to date. This list now stands at well over 1,000 scientists.204

“ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES”: MY FRIEND, BARBARA
BOXER
Most people are surprised when I say this, but I really like Barbara Boxer.
She’s always wrong on the environment, and our debates have been very
fierce at times, but we’ve been great friends for many years, and we have a
lot of lively memories as we’ve alternated the leadership of the Environment
and Public Works Committee. I handed the Chairmanship over to her in
January 2007, and, as she put it at that particularly fiery hearing with Al
Gore, waving the gavel in front of my face, “You don’t do this anymore.
Elections have consequences.” It was all in good fun, but I joked that she’s
just set herself up for a repeat of those words when things change back again.

So she was making the rules in 2007 and the structure of the committee

was very different than it was when I held the gavel. For one thing, instead of
examining the economic implications of the “solutions” to global warming,
as I was determined to do as Chairman, we had twenty hearings focusing on

the dangers of global warming, including “Global Warming and Wildfire,”
“The Examination of the Views of Religious Organizations Regarding Global
Warming,” and “Global Warming Impacts on the Chesapeake Bay”—my
favorite being the affect of global warming on the tourism industry.

The irony seemed to be lost on my colleagues that we were having

endless discussions about how urgent global warming was and how we must
act now or the world will end; yet they were in no hurry to discuss the
“solution” of cap and trade. It wasn’t until October 2007 that Senator Boxer
finally held a hearing on the newest cap and trade bill introduced by Senators
Joseph Lieberman and John Warner.

In truth, I wasn’t at all surprised that there was very little effort to

examine cap and trade seriously. No one on their side wanted to discuss the
economic pain that it would cause. It was legislation that would, as the
sponsor of the bill admitted, cost “hundreds of billions of dollars,” and, as
The Washington Post put it, “require a wholesale transformation of the
nation’s economy and society.”205 I could see why my good friend and
climate foe didn’t want to broadcast that this bill would be largest tax
increase in American history.

Barbara and I had a big interview with Larry King on January 31, 2007,

just a few weeks after she had taken up the gavel. I was waiting in the
greenroom where they mic you up a few minutes before you go on air, when
Barbara came out of the make-up room ready to battle it out with me on cap
and trade. She had an entourage of staff with her so I turned to them: “Don’t
worry, it won’t get too hostile. You may not believe it but Barbara and I
actually like each other,” I said, patting her on the head. But I apparently
destroyed her hairdo and her staffers were horrified; she immediately ran
back into the make-up room with her staffers close at her heels to get it fixed.
Barbara and I have fought each other on cap and trade and global warming

for many years, but we’ve had some good laughs too. At one memorable
hearing, I gave her a gift: it was a coffee mug with a picture of the world’s
coastline being inundated with water from global warming when one pours
liquid in the cup. But she had a good sense of humor about it: as seriously as
she takes the issue, she couldn’t help but laugh.

Larry King put it well when he said at the close of our interview with him,
“Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California. James Inhofe, Republican
of Oklahoma. And, by the way, they are good friends.”206

CAP AND TRADE AGAIN: LIEBERMAN-WARNER DIES
In October 2007, Al Gore and the IPCC together won the Nobel Peace Prize
for their work to bring widespread attention to the emergency of global
warming. Yet even so, and despite the efforts of the Hollywood elite and the
mainstream media, Senator Boxer still couldn’t sell the Lieberman-Warner
cap and trade bill in the Senate.

Here’s how it all shook down: the United Nations Climate Change

Conference in Bali was just around the corner, so Barbara was in a rush to
get Lieberman-Warner passed out of Committee so she could meet world
leaders with a climate “victory” under her belt. Along with Senators
Voinovich and Barrasso, I requested a full economic analysis of the bill by
the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Information
Administration before proceeding to a committee vote. We maintained that it
was irresponsible to move forward without knowing the full extent of the
economic damage resulting from this bill. There were also many attempts by
Republicans to offer amendments that would mitigate its negative economic
consequences—but these were completely rejected and only Democrat
amendments were added.

The business meeting to pass the bill was in December 2007. It was the

first time a cap and trade bill ever made it through the Environment and
Public Works Committee and all Republicans, except for Senator Warner,
voted against it. We had been ignored; in her rush to get it out the door,
Barbara opted to wait to address the more significant obstacles, including the
economic damage of the bill, until it reached the Senate floor.

The “obstacles” were indeed significant. At the time, Duke Energy Corp.
Chairman Jim Rogers warned that the bill will cause a “customer revolt” due
to a rise in electricity bills by as much as 53 percent in 2012.207
Additionally, the widely respected nonpartisan Charles River Associates
issued a November 8 analysis of the bill, revealing it would result in $4
trillion to $6 trillion in welfare costs over forty years and up to $1 trillion
per year by 2050.208 Even the co-author of the bill, Senator Lieberman,
conceded on November 1 that his bill would cost “hundreds of billions of
dollars.” The American Council for Capital Formation’s analysis on
November 8 found the bill would lead “to higher energy prices, lost jobs and
reduced [gross domestic product].”209 Two unlikely groups agreed on this
one point as well: the AFL-CIO was worried, saying that “the bill would

cost jobs by giving a competitive advantage to foreign companies that aren’t
subject to similar restrictions,”210 and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said
that it “does not adequately preserve American jobs and the domestic
economy.”211

Not only would Lieberman-Warner have been a disaster for the economy,
it also would have brought our country to an abrupt halt. That’s because the
bill did not include nuclear, and without it, we would have been severely
lacking in baseload power, as fossil fuels were gradually phased out. The
lack of nuclear may have been a blessing in disguise for my good friend John
McCain, as it gave him an out not to support a bill that was very similar to
the one he introduced a few years before. He had already launched his
campaign for president and, understandably, he did not want to vote for the
largest tax increase in American history.

Senator Reid brought Lieberman-Warner to the Senate floor in June 2008,

but the results were already in before the vote was even taken. It was
obvious that the Democrats were not at all serious about the bill. To put it in
perspective, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments were considered on the
Senate floor for five weeks, due to the substantial impact they would have.
Lieberman-Warner was even more consequential economically, yet
Democrats had no interest even in considering our amendments that would
protect American families and workers from the devastating effects of this
bill. On June 3, Roll Call quoted frustrated Democrat staffers saying, “We
have no strategy, no message, and no plan” and, “Boxer is walking us off a
cliff.”212

During the floor debate all the Democrats, true to form, were talking about

nothing but the science and how global warming was real. Senator Boxer
was no exception—in fact, she said very little about the bill itself; it was all
about how we must act now because the science was settled. So I went down
to the Senate floor and conceded the science. I said, “Let’s say we are
headed toward unspeakable catastrophe, would cap and trade save us?”
Absolutely not. That’s because only America would be taking action: China,
Mexico, and India have no intention of inflicting this kind of economic harm
on themselves so as jobs move to those countries where they don’t have any
emissions limits, global temperatures would actually increase. It would be
all economic pain—significantly higher energy costs, hundreds of thousands
of lost jobs, and a depressed economy—for nothing.

This strategy really threw Senators Boxer, Kerry, and others for a loop as

they came to the Senate floor fully prepared to have a science debate with
their doom and gloom pictures of polar bears, melting glaciers and
hurricanes. Instead, what they got was a debate on economics and costs,
which until then had taken a back seat to the dramatic images.

During that week in June when the Lieberman-Warner bill was debated on

the Senate floor, I carried around a memo with four themes based solely on
economics. They were taxes, jobs, gas prices, and nuclear power. The
themes quickly got the attention of the American people and my fellow
Republican colleagues, setting the stage for the economic debate on the
Waxman-Markey bill later in 2009 and 2010.

The news hit them hard: “Government studies confirm this bill will only

raise gas prices”;213 “$6.7 trillion in the form of higher gasoline and
electricity bills”;214 “1.8 million jobs lost by 2020 and 4 million by 2030
according to the National Association of Manufacturers.”215 The economic
impacts of the bill drove the debate and we continued to build on these
themes as the week went on.

I argued how many American jobs would be lost to developing countries
such as China, India, and Brazil that have been allowed to emit greenhouse
gasses without international criticism. For instance, China had built 117
government-approved coal-fired power plants in 2005— a rate of roughly
one every three days, according to official figures. Without international
participation, I argued, which this bill failed to address adequately, global
concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to increase, even if
America were to nearly eliminate its emissions. This news was indeed
alarming to my opponents, and it continued to throw them off as they hastily
tried to respond to the economic findings with continued emphasis on science
and doom and gloom scenarios.

It wasn’t just industry making these assumptions. The independent Energy
Information Administration said the bill would result in a 9.5 percent drop in
manufacturing output and higher energy costs, and that it would be worse
unless we could build 268 new nuclear plants by 2030.216 This country had
already lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. The EPA itself even
estimated that the Lieberman-Warner bill would increase fuel costs an
additional 53 cents per gallon by 2030 and $1.40 by 2050.217

Sponsors of the bill also failed to tell the American people that it would

generate over $6.7 trillion in revenues through 2050 from the sale and
auction of carbon allowance to energy users.218 Unfortunately, that $6.7
trillion cost would be passed on to families and workers across the country
in the form of higher gas prices, higher electricity bills, more expensive
consumer goods, and higher workplace costs.219 In fact, new funding for
government programs, minus any set asides for transition assistance or tax
relief to states, industry, or consumers under the Act is a staggering $4.2
trillion. I made sure to shine light on these numbers, emphasizing what it
would mean for American families. For example, according to various
economic models, this bill would cost $3,298 to Oklahoma families in 2020
and cut over 51,000 jobs through the life of the bill.220

We continued to hammer these themes during that week, but even though

my staff suggested that I stick to the economics during the debate afterwards I
still had a few things to say about the science so unbeknownst to them, I went
back down to the floor to give them an extra dose of reality on that point, too.
Senator Boxer maintained Democrats “had 54 Senators come down on the

side of tackling this crucial issue now” following the cloture vote of 48–36
which effectively killed the bill. But she did not take into account a letter that
was signed on June 6 by ten Democratic Senators who explicitly stated that
“they cannot support final passage” of the “Climate Tax Bill.” The letter
showed that Boxer would have only had at most 39 votes to support final
passage of the bill. As the letter stated,

As Democrats from regions of the country that will be most immediately
affected by climate legislation, we want to share our concerns with the
bill that is currently before the Senate. We commend your leadership in
attempting to address one of the most significant threats to this and future
generations; however, we cannot support final passage of the Boxer
Substitute in its current form.221

The ten Democratic Senators were: Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Senator

John D. Rockefeller (D-WV), Carl Levin (D-MI), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR),
Mark Pryor (D-AR), Jim Webb (D-VA), Evan Bayh (D-IN), Claire
McCaskill (D-MO), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Ben Nelson (D-NE). Of
the ten Senators, only Senator Brown voted against cloture.

All in all, the bill didn’t have the slightest chance of passing. Republicans
were prepared to debate the bill and were ready to offer amendments. But the
Democrats did not want to debate, much less vote, on our amendments that
were aimed at protecting American families and workers from the severe
economic impacts of this bill. Even if it made it through the Senate,
Democrats knew the House would never pass it, and even if they jumped that
hurdle, Bush would have vetoed it. But that wasn’t really the point. The point
was to show leaders at the UN Climate Conference that the Senate had taken
action. They had a symbolic victory just in time for Bali and their plan was
to use it as a model for future success—but it would never turn into an actual
victory.

As I predicted, it all came crashing down when the economic reality of
the bill was exposed. When faced with the inconvenient truth of the bill’s
impact on skyrocketing energy prices, very few Senators were able to come
out in support of the bill.

I was surprised that environmentalists were so “stunned that their global
warming agenda was in collapse” in the wake of the bill’s failure because
that was obvious to me. That quote came from a June 6, 2008, article in the
Wall Street Journal which also noted that “green groups now look as
politically intimidating as the skinny kid on the beach who gets sand kicked
in his face. Those groups spent millions advertising and lobbying to push the
cap and trade bill through the Senate.”222

THE GORE EFFECT
God has a sense of humor. December 5, 2007, was a particularly cold and
snowy day to be passing the Lieberman-Warner global warming bill out of
committee. In the middle of the markup, just before I voted no on Lieberman-
Warner, I walked outside the Dirksen Senate Office Building to meet a
reporter from the Business and Media Institute who was braving the cold to
catch me for an interview. I told him that the bill would suffer the same fate
as the McCain-Lieberman bill on the Senate floor due to its enormous
pricetag. Looking around at the snowflakes, I asked the question I asked Gore
in that fateful hearing: Where’s global warming when you need it?

5

THE MOMENT ARRIVES AND THE

MOVEMENT COLLAPSES

THE MOUNTAIN
On December 3, 2009, just days before the Copenhagen climate conference,
Rachel Maddow aired a five-minute segment featuring me, the “unmovable”
denier:

ANNOUNCER: For climate change activists, James Mountain Inhofe is
an inconvenient truth […] The M. stands for Mountain. No really his
name is James Mountain Inhofe and what a mighty unyielding alp he is.
All others are just foothills.

[…]

ANNOUNCER: Yes, elections do have consequences. Senator Inhofe
just won reelection last year. So we’ll be in the shadow of this mountain
until at least January 3, 2015.

RACHEL: Two questions for you Kent. Number one: his middle name is
actually Mountain?

KENT JONES: Yeah.

RACHEL: Not a TMI invention?

KENT: For real. Mountain. James Mountain Inhofe.

RACHEL: Did he also really suggest that the Weather Channel was
trying to boost its ratings?

KENT: He said they’d like that. Yeah, that’d be great. They’d love it if
we were afraid all the time.223

Rachel’s segment was one of the last major efforts to go after me just days

before I landed in Copenhagen and declared vindication, but as I said at a
bloggers’ luncheon at the Heritage Foundation when they asked me what I
thought about the clip, “You know, I’ve really grown to like that gal. She
thinks she’s saying such hateful things about me, but they’re all true”224 —
including the Mountain part. Mountain is my mother’s maiden name. If I was
indeed a “mountain of indignation” for global warming activists, as Rachel’s
segment claimed, it was only because I was a vehicle for the truth and that
was an insurmountable obstacle for them. For all the time, money, and effort
that they poured into their message that global warming was man-made and
catastrophic, Americans were starting to see the truth: the science was not
settled and their “solutions” were dead on arrival.

THE STARS ALIGN
In January 2009, from the outside looking in, it seemed that the United States
was poised to open a new chapter in environmental policy. Barack Obama—
the climate savior who had promised to slow the rise of the oceans and heal
the planet under his plan of a cap and trade system—had just been sworn in
as President of the United States. His allies in Congress were ready to take
action: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid had made commitments that they were going to pass cap and
trade. The international stage was set for President Obama to arrive in
Copenhagen in December and finally bind the United States to an
international agreement to limit greenhouse gases. The stars were aligned for
the first time ever. The moment they had been waiting for had finally arrived.

But by the end of 2009, it was all over, leaving the UK Guardian to ask

bewildered:

How can everything have gone so wrong so quickly? A year ago, the
prospects for successful climate change regulation were bright: a new
U.S. president promised positive re-engagement with the international
community on the issue, civil society everywhere was enthusiastically
mobilising to demand that world leaders ‘seal the deal’ at Copenhagen,

and the climate denial crowd had been reduced to an embarrassing rump
lurking in the darker corners of the internet. Now there seems to have
been a complete reversal.225

In January of that year, while my environmental friends were popping the
champagne, blinded by the euphoria of being so close to victory, I went to the
Senate floor to give them a dose of reality. I said that no matter how closely
stars were aligned on Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Avenue, cap and trade
would never pass and the science would implode under the pressure of its
own flaws.

MEDIA MANIA CONCEDES TO SKEPTICISM
In fact, the irony is that the movement fell from inevitability to failure
precisely because the stars were so aligned. With the full control of both
Houses of Congress and the White House, many believed that cap and trade
could become the law of the land, so they began to take a serious look at
what that would actually mean.

I began my own investigation into the science in 2003, because I found out

how much the “solution” would cost and I said that if the United States was
even going to consider such expensive, drastic measures that would
fundamentally change our economy, the science driving that decision had
better be solid. After my rigorous research, I found that it was not—and over
the course of six years, more and more flaws continued to surface.
Importantly, this was exactly the process that the media and many members of
Congress undertook during that year: they realized that we may be seriously
considering a solution that would destroy our already ailing economy so they
decided to take a harder look at the science—and when they did, they found
the man-made catastrophic theory wanting.

By then the Hollywood hysteria had faded into the sunset and the media
could no longer indulge in hyped-up fears of climate catastrophe focusing
only on the “problem” and ignoring the “solution” as Miles O’Brien did in
our 2007 interview when he dismissed my concerns about Kyoto: “We’re not
talking about Kyoto…We’re talking about whether global warming is real.”
Now that the “solution,” was on the horizon, they were forced to face up to it
and the economic catastrophe that it would cause. In droves, they started
going back to take another look at the science.

In 2007, Washington Post staff writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the

obvious, writing that climate skeptics “appeared to be expanding rather than
shrinking.”226 The mainstream media was finally beginning to take notice. A
November 25, 2008, article in Politico reported that a “growing
accumulation” of science is challenging warming fears, and added that the
“science behind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant cap and
trade legislation.”227 On October 20, 2008, Canada’s National Post said that
“the number of climate change skeptics is growing rapidly.”228 And New York
Times environmental reporter, Andrew Revkin, noted on March 6, 2008, “As
we all know, climate science is not a numbers game (there are heaps of
signed statements by folks with advanced degrees on all sides of this
issue).”229

So even before it all collapsed at the end of the year with the Climategate
scandal, the science was already well on its way to imploding and the media
was starting to catch on to that fact. It was truly the “Year of the Skeptic.”

WAXMAN MARKEY PASSES IN THE HOUSE: “WE’LL KILL IT IN
THE SENATE”
On Friday, June 26, 2009, Democrats made history. For the first time, a cap
and trade bill—sponsored by Representatives Henry Waxman and Ed
Markey—passed in the House of Representatives. The House debated the
bill all night, and John Boehner stood his ground throwing the 1,400-page
document on the desk, saying: “Are we really going to pass a bill that will
remake our entire economy in one night, when no one has even read it?”
With the passage of Waxman-Markey that morning, Americans were
subjected to yet another significant change in environmental rhetoric. No
longer were we moving forward with this effort to avert major climate
catastrophe; we were doing this, more importantly, because we needed to
transition to a clean energy future. Notably absent in President Obama’s
ringing endorsement of the bill was any mention of global warming or
climate change—or cap and trade for that matter:

This week, the House of Representatives is moving ahead on historic
legislation that will transform the way we produce and use energy in
America. This legislation will spark a clean energy transformation that

will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and confront the carbon
pollution that threatens our planet.

This energy bill will create a set of incentives that will spur the
development of new sources of energy, including wind, solar, and
geothermal power. It will also spur new energy savings, like efficient
windows and other materials that reduce heating costs in the winter and
cooling costs in the summer.

These incentives will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of

energy. And that will lead to the development of new technologies that
lead to new industries that could create millions of new jobs in America
— jobs that can’t be shipped overseas.

At a time of great fiscal challenges, this legislation is paid for by the

polluters who currently emit the dangerous carbon emissions that
contaminate the water we drink and pollute the air that we breathe. It also
provides assistance to businesses and communities as they make the
gradual transition to clean energy technologies.

[…]

We all know why this is so important. The nation that leads in the

creation of a clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the 21st
century’s global economy. That’s what this legislation seeks to achieve—
it’s a bill that will open the door to a better future for this nation. And
that’s why I urge members of Congress to come together and pass it.230

Suddenly we had to pass this bill so that we could reduce carbon

“pollution” and create “green jobs”? What happened to saving the world?
This kind of language was also the headline of Senator Boxer’s first climate
change hearing in July 2009 when she said, “Today’s hearing is the kickoff of
a historic Senate effort to pass legislation that will reduce our dependence on
foreign oil, create millions of clean energy jobs, and protect our children
from pollution.”231 Just as there was a decided shift in rhetoric from global
warming to climate change around 2005–2007, there was a sudden shift in
rhetoric from averting climate catastrophe to transitioning to a clean energy

economy in 2009. They had to change their strategy to try to counter the
reality that cap and trade would destroy jobs.

This did not go unnoticed by the mainstream media. As the New York

Times put it:

The problem with global warming, some environmentalists believe, is
‘global warming.’ The term turns people off, fostering images of shaggy-
haired liberals, economic sacrifice and complex scientific disputes,
according to extensive polling and focus group sessions conducted by
ecoAmerica, a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in
Washington.232
The LA Times also reported:

Scratch ‘cap and trade’ and ‘global warming,’ Democratic pollsters tell
Obama. They’re ineffective…Control the language, politicians know and
you stand a better chance of controlling the debate. So the Obama
administration, in its push to enact sweeping energy and healthcare
policies, has begun refining the phrases it uses in an effort to shape
public opinion. Words that have been vetted in focus groups and polls are
seeping into the White House lexicon, while others considered too scary
or confounding are falling away.233

As the LA Times rightly points out, cap and trade had also become a

forbidden phrase. Senator Kerry later made his famous statement in
September, “I don’t know what ‘cap and trade’ means. I don’t think the
average American does. This is not a cap and trade bill, it’s a pollution
reduction bill.”234 I said that if Kerry didn’t know what cap and trade meant,
he only had to ask his Democratic colleague in the House, John Dingell, who
had defined it beautifully: “a tax and a big one.”235

President Obama was clearly moving away from the catastrophe rhetoric,

Senator Kerry was pushing green jobs and energy security, and their ranks
were in disarray with the messaging. Several Democrats still hadn’t let go of
the idea of preventing bad weather by acts of Congress. Even in the same
opening statement where Senator Boxer headlined with green jobs, she
mentioned toward the end the “devastating effects that will come in the future
if we do not take action to cut global warming pollution. Droughts, floods,

fires, loss of species, damage to agriculture, worsening air pollution and
more.” Senator Debbie Stabenow also hadn’t let go of the catastrophe, saying
in August 2009, “Climate change is very real. Global warming creates
volatility. I feel it when I’m flying. The storms are more volatile. We are
paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes.”236

The final tally of Waxman-Markey’s passage in the House portended its

demise. The vote was 219–212, which meant that a large number of
Democrats had voted against it. If a 1,400-page bill that’s designed to
transform our economy only passed by seven votes, I knew it didn’t stand a
chance in the Senate.

The day before the vote, I was traveling back to Tulsa and stopped by the
Countrywide and Sun newspaper in Shawnee, Oklahoma. A reporter asked
me what would happen if the House passed cap and trade and I said, “It
doesn’t matter because we’ll kill it in the Senate anyway.”237

CAP AND TRADE COMES TO THE SENATE
It was like Lieberman-Warner all over again, except this time Senator Boxer
couldn’t even get cap and trade to the Senate floor.

From the moment Waxman-Markey passed in the House, the Environment
and Public Works Committee under the Chairmanship of Boxer held hearing
after hearing on such topics as “Update on the Latest Global Warming
Science,” “Moving America toward a Clean Energy Economy and Reducing
Global Warming Pollution: Legislative Tools,” “Clean Energy Jobs, Climate-
Related Policies and Economic Growth—State and Local Views,” “Climate
Change and National Security”—and as before, what Senator Boxer was not
as anxious to discuss was cap and trade legislation itself.

But we weren’t going to let her get away with that. It didn’t matter what

the topic of the hearing was. My Republican colleagues and I made it a
priority to shine the spotlight on the bill itself and the economic burden it
would place on our country. If our friends in the House had debated the bill
under the cover of night, we were determined to expose it to the light of day.

At the end of each hearing, I asked my staff to put together a series of

YouTube videos that exposed particular faults in cap and trade legislation.
There were three pivotal videos that made a significant impact on the debate.

HEARING HIGHLIGHTS: LISA JACKSON CONFIRMS CAP AND
TRADE ALL COST, NO GAIN
When President Obama came into office, he brought with him a substantial
green team, but I was very pleased that his choice for EPA Administrator,
Lisa Jackson, was someone I really liked and respected. Before she joined
the Obama Administration, Lisa had testified before the Environment and
Public Works Committee on a range of issues from chemical security to
mercury legislation when she served as the Director of the New Jersey
Environmental Protection Agency office. I had the chance to meet with her
again before her nomination hearing, and we talked at length about our
families, values, and about the importance of having a healthy respect for our
differences of opinion. Lisa left with two items in her hand: my report
documenting hundreds of scientists who dispute global warming alarmism
and a Christmas card with a picture of my family. She told me that she has
that picture hanging on her wall in her office. Lisa and I rarely agree when it
comes to environmental policy, but we are good friends and I am always
happy to welcome her to the Environment and Public Works Committee.

I especially appreciated her testimony during a particular hearing in July
2009 when she conceded what I had been saying all along: climate change
legislation in the United States would be all pain for no gain. At one point
during the hearing, I put up a chart of an EPA analysis, which showed that the
United States acting alone to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would have no
affect on global temperatures, and asked her to confirm that this chart was
accurate. She said, “I believe the central parts of the [EPA] chart are that
U.S. action alone will not impact world CO2 levels.”238 One of the reasons I
respect Lisa so much is that when you ask her a question, she gives you an
honest answer—as she did that day. To have the head of the EPA come out
and admit that this bill would have no impact on the climate was a game
changer.

Interestingly, just a few weeks before, President Obama in a June 25,
2009, interview covered by the San Francisco Chronicle, said, “A long-
term benefit [of cap and trade] is we’re leaving a planet to our children that
isn’t four or five degrees hotter.” He clearly failed to consult his own EPA on
that matter.239

HEARING HIGHLIGHTS: GOVERNORS REJECT WAXMAN
MARKEY
That July, we also welcomed several governors to testify before the
committee for a hearing titled, “Clean Energy Jobs, Climate-Related
Policies, and Economic Growth—State and Local Views.” Of course, cap
and trade was not the intended topic of the hearing, but I made it a point to
ask each Governor present how they felt about the Waxman-Markey bill,
which put them all in a very uncomfortable position. I knew that Democratic
Governor Bill Ritter of Colorado had previously endorsed cap and trade so I
was anxious to see if he could still support Waxman-Markey as the governor
of a strong oil, gas and agriculture state. Interestingly, when pressed, he
could not say that he supported it:

Here’s what I support. I support a national energy policy that’s married to
a national climate policy that gets at these goals that we have for
greenhouse gas reductions. And I believe that if you do that, that there
will some vehicle that may not look exactly like Waxman-Markey,
particularly after the Senate finishes its work. But I very much support
climate legislation that is joined with a national energy policy to get us to
the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals that are set for 2050.240

Also telling was that Governors Gregoire (D-WA) and Corzine (D-NJ)

would not directly say that they endorsed Waxman-Markey.

HEARING HIGHLIGHTS: GREEN JOBS DEBUNKED
During one particularly lively hearing on the clean energy economy also in
July, we invited Harry Alford, President and CEO of the National Black
Chamber of Commerce, to discuss a new study conducted by the Black
Chamber of Commerce and CRA International on the economic effects of
Waxman-Markey. As Alford explained:

Climate change is a vital issue that must be addressed […] Regretfully,
the current legislation out of the U.S. House of Representatives will
negatively impact the most vulnerable of our society. I’m sure that those
who proposed it had the best intentions, but the bill doesn’t do what it’s

supposed to do, and it does so at a very high cost—especially high for
working families and small business owners.241

Alford also said that according to this study, “green jobs gained would be
swamped by jobs lost in old industries and businesses, leading to a net loss
of 2.3 million to 2.7 million jobs,” because so many industries supported by
fossil fuel development would be destroyed.

Then Senator Boxer let the cat out of the bag. She explained that the goal
of her forthcoming legislation was “softening the blow on our trade sensitive
industries and our consumers. I just want you to know that, that’s the goal.”242
I was glad that she finally admitted that cap and trade would impose
significant economic harm. Basically what she was saying was that
Washington would tax hard-working Americans, put them out of work, and
then cut them a check to help “soften the blow.” That didn’t sound like a very
effective “jobs bill.”243

THE MOMENT ARRIVES: KERRY-BOXER?
After a long summer of anticipation, Senators Kerry and Boxer finally held
an outdoor press conference on September 30, 2009, to introduce their cap
and trade bill in the Senate. Right away they faced several problems. First of
all, what they introduced that day was an outline—it was not a full bill.
Second, it had been clear for a while that a number of conservative
Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Senate would not support a bill
that was exactly the same as Waxman-Markey, so everyone was wondering
what changes they would make on the Senate bill to gain the support of
wavering members. Yet, when the bill surfaced, it appeared to be nearly
identical to Waxman-Markey. It was also curious that the bill was named
Kerry-Boxer rather than Boxer-Kerry since Boxer was, after all, the
Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.

CRSREPORT: AMERICA HAS THE LARGEST RESERVES OF
FOSSIL FUELS OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
On October 23, 2009, just weeks after cap and trade—a bill that would force
Americans into policies of energy austerity—came to the Senate, a report
from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) revealed for the

first time that America’s combined energy resources are the largest on
earth.244 Democrats trying to force us off of fossil fuels were not too pleased.
The report tells us that America’s combined recoverable natural gas, oil,
and coal endowment is the largest on Earth—far larger than those of Saudi
Arabia (third), China (fourth), and Canada (sixth) combined. I said, thanks to
the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, we now know what
resources we have and what we aren’t getting out of the ground. I requested
the report along with Senator Lisa Murkowski because we had grown tired
of the Democrats’ refrain that America only has 3 percent of global oil
reserves—which, according to this view, meant more drilling and production
at home would be futile. The 3 percent mantra is their bread and butter
talking point.

President Obama himself has said that with 3 percent of the world’s oil
reserves, the U.S. cannot drill its way to energy security. My Democratic
colleagues in the Senate have also said that the United States has only 3
percent of known oil reserves, yet we use 25 percent of the world’s oil
production. But the non-partisan CRS shows the full, complete, accurate
picture of America’s resources—and shows that, yes, we can produce our
way to energy security.

That’s because CRS shows more than just our proven oil reserves, which

is what the Democrats conveniently cite. America’s proven reserves, of
course, are a modest 28 billion barrels. The word “proven” is important
here. The only way to estimate proven reserves is to drill. But that’s not
possible because federal policies, supported by President Obama and many
Democrats, have made of America’s federal land inaccessible to drilling.
Knowing what vast resources literally lay at our feet, it seemed all the
more outrageous that we were even considering such drastic measures to
limit access to these resources.

THE “NUCLEAR OPTION”
Although Kerry-Boxer was “introduced” at the end of September 2009, it
took Senators Kerry and Boxer almost a month to draft the full bill, which we
received just before midnight on October 23. Senator Boxer planned to begin
marking up the bill November 3, 2009, in the Environment and Public Works
Committee.

As was the case with Lieberman-Warner, Republicans understandably

wanted to have an economic analysis of Kerry-Boxer completed before
voting on the bill in committee. Leading the charge on this request was
Senator Voinovich from Ohio, a state that would be hit hard by the
legislation.

At that stage, EPA had already completed an analysis of Waxman-Markey
but they had used unrealistic assumptions—one of them being that the United
States would construct 103 new nuclear power plants to make up for lost
baseload power from the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels. The idea that we
could license and construct that many nuclear power plants was absurd
considering that no new power plants have been licensed for thirty years.
Senator Voinovich requested that EPA conduct an economic analysis of
Kerry-Boxer using more realistic assumptions. But Senator Boxer claimed
that our request was only a delay tactic. She said we had enough economic
information in our hands to move the bill through Committee.

This disagreement over economic modeling set the stage for a

confrontation in the Environment and Public Works Committee that was
unprecedented. We stood our ground that we could not move forward with a
markup until we had adequate economic modeling of the bill. Senator Boxer
decided to hold the markup anyway, breaking longstanding precedent that two
members of the minority must be present for a markup to begin. Again, as
with Lieberman-Warner, the Copenhagen conference was just around the
corner, so Senator Boxer was determined to have this bill passed out of
committee to show world leaders that we were taking action.

But as Darren Samuelsohn of Politico correctly noted, the consequences
for breaking precedent were high: “Going this route […] could spell trouble
for the overall legislation as Boxer and her allies continue their search for 60
votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans. ‘That product is totally
toxic,’ the former staffer warned. ‘It’s basically worthless.’”245

Senator Voinovich attended the markup only on the first day to ask Senator

Boxer one last time to allow us to complete the economic analysis before
proceeding; when she refused, he left. I briefly attended the last day of the
markup to reinforce our message, but she would not concede.

Cap and trade was already dead, but Senator Boxer’s decision to break
with committee precedent put the last nail in the coffin. I walked straight out
of the committee room to the Russell rotunda to give an interview with

Martha MacCallum of Fox News on November 5, 2009. I explained how it
would all turn out:

INHOFE: We’re not going to pass this huge bill. This would be the
largest tax increase in the history of America—[we said we would] not
pass it out of committee until we had an EPA analysis. We’ve requested it
now for two months. And they’re waiting to do it but they won’t give
them the go ahead. I can only conclude that they don’t want the public to
know how much money this thing’s going to cost. So they’ve done
something that’s never been done in the history of this committee. They
passed a bill out without one member of the minority—not one
Republican. You know, Martha, let’s keep in mind all the town meetings
that we went through. That was about health care but that was also about
this global warming monstrous tax. And I’ll tell you this is unprecedented
and I think the bill is dead. By the way, one Democrat voted against it and
that was Max Baucus. He’s from Montana but he’s also the chairman of
the Finance Committee. So that bill is dead. […] I really honestly believe
this is history in the making right now because it’s never happened
before. I can’t see any way in the world that Harry Reid is going to bring
this bill up and it could pass. It just can’t happen.246

CAP AND TRADE IS DEAD
It wasn’t long before I could declare victory. By the middle of November, the
Environment and Public Works Committee was back to work on other issues
in the hearing room, and I had the chance to have a little fun after Barbara’s
“elections have consequences” jab. It turns out that votes have consequences
too. I was happy to declare, “We won, you lost, get a life!”247

6

CLIMATEGATE = VINDICATION

THE COLLAPSE OF THE SCIENCE

When I said I’ve been called every name in the book, I wasn’t kidding. In
stark contrast to Rachel Maddow’s depiction of me as a “mountain of
indignation,” Dana Milbank wrote in an October 28, 2009, in The
Washington Post column, “It must be very lonely being the last flat-earther.”
It was probably the last time a reporter could get away with singling me out
as the only one who wasn’t buying into the flawed science behind the global
warming campaign. Milbank continued making his case:

“Eleven academies in industrialized countries say that climate change is
real; humans have caused most of the recent warming,” admitted Sen.
Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). “If fire chiefs of the same reputation told me
my house was about to burn down, I’d buy some fire insurance.” An oil-
state senator, David Vitter (R-La), said that he, too, wants to “get us
beyond high-carbon fuels” and “focus on conservation, nuclear, natural
gas and new technologies like electric cars.” And an industrial-state
senator, George Voinovich (R-Ohio), acknowledged that climate change
“is a serious and complex issue that deserves our full attention.” Then
there was poor Inhofe.248

Just a few weeks after that column appeared, it was all over: Climategate,

the greatest scientific scandal of our time, broke. So I said Milbank didn’t
have to feel too sorry for me. What I had been saying about the IPCC all
along was confirmed. I was vindicated.

On November 18, 2009, just two days before Climategate, I went back
down to the Senate floor to speak about how the “consensus” was already
shattered and Copenhagen would fail. I said that 2009 would go down in

history as the “Year of the Skeptic.” I had a few allies in this assertion: the
Telegraph, a UK Newspaper, was predicting Copenhagen would be a
disaster on November 15, 2009: “The worst kept secret in the world is
finally out—the climate change summit in Copenhagen is going to be little
more than a photo opportunity for world leaders.”249 I said I would be there
to tell them the truth:

And I will be travelling to Copenhagen, leading what I call the “Truth
Squad” to say exactly what I said six years ago in Milan, Italy: The
United States will not support a global warming treaty that will
significantly damage the American economy, cost American jobs, and
impose the largest tax increase in American history. Further, as I stated in
2003, unless developing nations are part of the binding agreement, the
U.S. will not go along. Given the unemployment rate of 10 percent, and
given all of the out of control spending in Washington, the last thing we
need is another thousand-page bill that increases costs and ships jobs
overseas, all with no impact on climate change.

I also said in Milan that the science is not settled. That was an

unpopular view back then. But today, since Al Gore’s science fiction
movie, more and more scientists, reporters, and politicians are
questioning global warming alarmism. I proudly declare 2009 as the
“Year of the Skeptic”—the year in which scientists who question the so-
called global warming consensus are being heard.250

So Copenhagen was already well on its way to failure. When Climategate
hit, it only added superfluous nails to a coffin that was already tightly nailed
shut.

Climategate revealed leaked emails from the world’s top climate

scientists at the University East Anglia’s Climactic Research Unit, many of
whom had been lead authors of the IPCC reports and were intimately
involved in writing and editing the IPCC’s science assessments. My Senate
report showed that many of these scientists may be obstructing the release of
information that was contrary to their “consensus” claims; may be
manipulating data using flawed climate models to reach preconceived
conclusions; may be pressuring journal editors not to publish work

questioning the “consensus”; and assuming activist roles to influence the
political process.251

The implications of this were huge considering that the “consensus” claim

was based on the foundation of the IPCC science. Noted science historian
Naomi Oreskes wrote, the “scientific consensus” of climate change “is
clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change.”252 One top Obama Administration official said that the IPCC’s
assessments were the “gold standard” on climate science “because of the
rigorous way in which they are prepared, reviewed, and approved.”253

Each of the IPCC’s four assessment reports made the scientific case—
more definitely over time—that anthropogenic gases were causing global
warming. The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report’s Summary for
Policymakers in 2007 claimed that “warming of the climate system is
unequivocal” and that “[m]ost of the observed increase in globally averaged
temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed
increase in anthropogenic (human) greenhouse gas concentrations.”254

Climategate finally destroyed what was left of the façade of the

“consensus.” Contrary to their repeated public assertions that the “science is
settled,” the emails show climate scientists were arguing over critical issues,
questioning key methods and statistical techniques, expressing concerns
about historical periods (such as whether the Medieval Warming Period
[MWP] was global in extent) and doubting whether there is “consensus” on
the causes and the extent of climate change.

The press reaction in the wake of the scandal was remarkable considering
how just a few years before they had nothing but praise for the IPCC. George
Monbiot, a British writer, known for his environmental and political
activism, wrote in his weekly column in the Guardian: “Pretending that this
isn’t a real crisis isn’t going to make it go away. Nor is an attempt to justify
the emails with technicalities. We’ll be able to get past this only by grasping
reality, apologising where appropriate, and demonstrating that it cannot
happen again.”255 The Daily Telegraph said that “this scandal could well be
the greatest in modern science.”256 Clive Crook of the Atlantic magazine
wrote, “The closed-mindedness of these supposed men of science, their
willingness to go to any lengths to defend a preconceived message, is

surprising even to me. The stink of intellectual corruption is
overpowering.”257

But comedian Jon Stewart was the best—he said, “Poor Al Gore: global

warming completely debunked via the very Internet you invented. Oh the
irony!” He went on:

STEWART: Value added data? What is that, numbers fortified with art?
Truth plus, now with lemon? It doesn’t look good. Now does it disprove
global warming? No, of course not. But it does put a fresh set of
energizers in the Senate’s resident denier bunny.

SENATOR JAMES INHOFE, (R-OKLA.): The fact that this whole
idea on the global warming. I’m glad that’s over, gone, done. We won.
You lost. Get a life.

STEWART: Alright. We knew Inhofe was going to say that. That guy
thinks global warming is debunked every time he drinks a Slushee and
gets a brain freeze. “If global warming is real, why does my head hurt?”
But by the way, that quote was from BEFORE he found out about the
leaked email story. But that’s the point. If you care about an issue, and
want it to be your life’s work, don’t cut corners.258

It was one of the first times someone called me out for being a “denier”

while also giving me credit for predicting how it would all end.

REWIND TO 2005
In 2005, I stood on the Senate floor to discuss the flaws in the IPCC process
that had been manifesting themselves for years, and said it was time to face
up to the “systematic and documented abuse of the scientific process by
which an international body that claims it provides the most complete and
objective science assessment in the world on the subject of climate change,
the United Nations IPCC.”259

At the time of my speech, the IPCC’s fourth assessment, which was meant

to be the “smoking gun” report—attempting to prove there was an
“unequivocal” link between humans and catastrophic global warming—was
set to come out in 2007.260 I said that if the IPCC and its fourth assessment

were to have any credibility, fundamental changes to the IPCC scientific
process would need to be made. Most importantly, I said that the IPCC must
adopt procedures that ensure that impartial scientific reviewers formally
approve both the chapters and the Summary for Policymakers—the latter of
which was the only document that members of the press and members of
Congress ever read. When compared with the actual report, it was clear the
Summary for Policymakers was being co-opted by activists with an agenda
to shape the conclusions to show that man-made emissions were causing
catastrophic global warming. To safeguard against the manipulation of the
message, objective scientists, not government delegates should be a part of
the approval process. I also said that the IPCC must ensure that any
uncertainties in the state of knowledge be clearly expressed in the Summary
for Policymakers.

But of course, the IPCC remained committed to its path and, as

Climategate eventually revealed, it was unsustainable and it was only a
matter of time before it collapsed.

THE “GOLD STANDARD”
Phil Jones, the head of the Climatic Research Unit, put it mildly when he
admitted that the Climategate emails “do not read well.”261

The emails themselves raised the important question: what, if any, are the

boundaries between science and activism? Perhaps the statement that best
exemplifies the unusual political tendency among the scientists in the CRU
controversy came from Dr. Keith Briffa, the Deputy Director of the CRU, and
lead author of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, who wrote in one of the
CRU emails, “I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC,
which were not always the same.”262 The most famous example comes from
an email from Phil Jones, which reads, “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature
trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from
1980 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”263 Of course,
he means hide the decline in temperatures, which caused another scientist,
Kevin Trenberth, to write: “The fact is we can’t account for the lack of
warming, and it’s a travesty that we can’t.”264

Climategate is significant in that it confirmed in the minds of many what

we strongly suspected all the time. It is imperative that you read Appendix C,

excerpts from our report on the CRU controversy which was published in
February 2010. It clearly documents the specific participants and statements
in Climategate.

HOCKEY STICK ANNIHILATED
If the hockey stick was already broken all the way back in 2003, after the
Climategate revelations, in 2009, it is more accurate to say that it was
shattered, as revealed in the following excerpts of my staff report on
Climategate emails.

Possibly the most egregious example of scientists trying to silence skeptic
voices was the reaction to a paper published in the journal Climate Research
in 2003, which posed a serious challenge to the “hockey stick” graph
constructed by Professors Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley, and Malcolm
Hughes. Of course, the hockey stick, which was featured prominently in the
IPCC’s Third Assessment Report in 2001, supported the conclusion that the
1990s, and 1998, were likely the warmest decade, and the warmest year,
respectively, in at least a millennium.

Dr. Sallie Baliunas and Dr. Willie Soon, researchers at the Harvard-

Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, contested the hockey stick conclusion;
they reviewed more than two hundred climate studies and “determined that
the 20th century is neither the warmest century nor the century with the most
extreme weather of the past 1000 years.” Their study “confirmed that the
Medieval Warm Period of 800 to 1300 A.D. and the Little Ice Age of 1300 to
1900 A.D., were worldwide phenomena not limited to the European and
North American continents. While 20th century temperatures are much higher
than in the Little Ice Age period, many parts of the world show the medieval
warmth to be greater than that of the 20th century.”265

As the leaked emails show, Michael Mann, the author of the hockey stick,
and Phil Jones, a climatologist at the University of East Anglia, were not too
happy about this. In an email on March 11, 2003, titled “Soon and Baliunas,”
Jones writes that he and his colleagues “should do something” about the
Soon-Baliunas study, the quality of which he found “appalling”: “I think the
skeptics will use this paper to their own ends and it will set paleo
[climatology] back a number of years if it goes unchallenged.” Jones then
went a step further, threatening to shun Climate Research until “they rid
themselves of this troublesome editor.”266

That same day, Mann responded, complaining that the skeptics had

“staged a bit of a coup” at Climate Research, implying that scientists who
disagree with him could never get published in peer-reviewed literature
solely on the merits of their work. Mann echoed Jones’ suggestion to punish
Climate Research by encouraging “our colleagues in the climate research
community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal:”

This was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing
in the “peer-reviewed literature.” Obviously, they found a solution to that
—take over a journal! So what do we do about this? I think we have to
stop considering “Climate Research” as a legitimate peer-reviewed
journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate
research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal.
We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more
reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board.267

In April 2003, Timothy Carter with the Finnish Environment Institute

suggested changes to the editorial process at Climate Research in an email to
Tom Wigley, a scientist formerly with the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research (UCAR). Noting communications with “Mike”
(Michael Mann) the previous morning, Carter wondered how to remove
“suspect editors,” presumably those who approve research by skeptics. In
reply, Wigley described a campaign to discredit Climate Research through a
letter signed by more than fifty scientists. He also mentioned Mann’s
approach to “get editorial board members to resign”:

One approach is to go direct to the publishers and point out the fact that
their journal is perceived as being a medium for disseminating
misinformation under the guise of refereed work. I use the word
“perceived” here, since whether it is true or not is not what the
publishers care about—it is how the journal is seen by the community
that counts. I think we could get a large group of highly credentialed
scientists to sign such a letter—50+ people. Note that I am copying this
view only to Mike Hulme and Phil Jones. Mike’s idea to get editorial
board members to resign will probably not work—must get rid of von
Storch too, otherwise holes will eventually fill up with people like
Legates, Balling, Lindzen, Michaels, Singer, etc. I have heard that the

publishers are not happy with von Storch, so the above approach might
remove that hurdle too.268

Along with these discussions about removing journal editors who held

contrary views on climate science, the emails show that the scientists tried to
prevent publication of papers they disagreed with. On July 8, 2004, Jones
suggested that he and a colleague could keep the work of skeptics from
appearing in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment report: “I can’t see either of
these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin and I will keep them out
somehow—even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature
is!”269

The conclusion is obvious: Mann and his colleagues were not

disinterested scientists. They acted more like a priestly caste, viewing
substantive challenges to their work as heresy. And rather than welcoming
criticism and debate as essential to scientific progress, they launched a
campaign of petty invective against scientists who dared to question their
findings and methods.

“HIDE THE DECLINE”
The following is more from my Environment and Public Works Committee’s
minority staff report on Climategate:

“I am not sure that this unusual warming is so clear in the summer
responsive data. I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched
about 1,000 years ago.” Keith Briffa, Deputy Director, CRU, September
22, 1999.

I asked what Dr. Mann was trying to hide in a speech on the Senate floor

on April 13, 2005, and Climategate emails provided the answer: he was
arguably hiding the decline in temperatures. One of the most famous emails is
written by CRU’s Jones in 1999: “I’ve just completed Mike [Mann]’s Nature
trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from
1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”270

Jones’s “trick” arose because of disagreement over Dr. Mann’s “hockey

stick” temperature graph. Of course, the hockey stick showed a relatively
straight shaft extending from 1000 AD to 1900, when a blade turns sharply

upward, suggesting that warming in the 20th century was unprecedented, and
caused by anthropogenic sources. Remember, the hockey stick was featured
prominently on page one of the IPCC’s Summary for Policymakers in its
Third Assessment Report.

In defending himself, Jones said, “The word ‘trick’ was used here

colloquially as in a clever thing to do. It is ludicrous to suggest that it refers
to anything untoward.”271 Similarly, echoing Jones, Dr. John Holdren,
President Obama’s Science Adviser, asserted that “trick” merely means a
clever way to tackle a problem.272 Both Holdren and Jones’ explanation of
“trick” used in this context has evidentiary support. Unfortunately, neither
Jones nor Holdren addressed the “problem” that confronted Jones and his
colleagues. The problem in this case is the so called “divergence problem.”
The divergence problem is the fact that after 1960, tree ring reconstructions
show a marked decline in temperatures, while the land-based, instrumental
temperature record shows just the opposite.

For some scientists, the divergence of data was a cause of great concern,

but not necessarily for scientific reasons. For instance, IPCC author Chris
Folland warned in an email that such evidence “dilutes the message rather
significantly” that warming in the late 20th century relative to the last 1,000
years is “unprecedented.”273

Specifically, Jones et al. expressed concern about a temperature

reconstruction authored by Keith Briffa, a senior researcher with CRU.
Because reliable thermometer data go back only to the 1850s, scientists use
proxy data such as tree rings to reconstruct annual temperatures over long
periods (e.g., 1,000 years) (it must be noted that proxy reconstructions are
rife with uncertainties).274

Unfortunately for those in the email chain, Briffa’s reconstruction relied
on tree ring proxies that produced a sharp and steady decline in temperature
after 1960. This conflicted with the instrumental temperature readings that
showed a steep rise. Briffa’s graph was, according to Dr. Michael Mann, a
“problem”:

Keith’s series…differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that
Phil’s does from ours. This is the problem we all picked up on (everyone
in the room at IPCC was in agreement that this was a problem and a

potential distraction/detraction from the reasonably consensus viewpoint
we’d like to show w/the Jones et al and Mann et al series.275

Briffa later addressed the “pressure to present a nice tidy story” about the

“unprecedented” warming in the late 20th century. In his view, “the recent
warmth was matched about 1,000 years ago.” Here is the email from Briffa
in full:

I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘apparent
unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data but
in reality the situation is not quite so simple. We don’t have a lot of
proxies that come right up to date and those that do (at least a significant
number of tree proxies) some unexpected changes in response that do not
match the recent warming. I do not think it wise that this issue be ignored
in the chapter. For the record, I do believe that the proxy data do show
unusually warm conditions in recent decades. I am not sure that this
unusual warming is so clear in the summer responsive data. I believe that
the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago. I do not
believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled
progressively over thousands of years as Mike appears to and I contend
that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the
Holocene (not Milankovich) that require explanation and that could
represent part of the current or future background variability of our
climate.276

Mann was apparently nervous that “skeptics” would have a “field day” if

Briffa’s decline was featured in the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report. He
said “he’d hate to be the one” to give them “fodder.” On September 22, 1999,
Mann wrote:

We would need to put in a few words in this regard. Otherwise, the
skeptics have a field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the
factors that influence these estimates and, thus, can undermine faith in the
paleoestimates. The best approach here is for us to circulate a paper
addressing all the above points. I’ll do this as soon as possible. I don’t
think that doubt is scientifically justified, and I’d hate to be the one to
have to give it fodder!277

As UK’s Daily Mail reported, “All [Jones] had to do was cut off Briffa’s
inconvenient data at the point where the decline started, in 1961, and replace
it with actual temperature readings, which showed an increase.”278

So it seems that, rather than employing a “clever way”—or “trick”—to
solve the post-1960 decline, Jones allegedly manipulated data to reach a
preconceived conclusion. His method has been criticized by fellow
scientists. Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at London’s
School of Oriental and African Studies said, “Any scientist ought to know
that you just can’t mix and match proxy and actual data. They’re apples and
oranges. Yet that’s exactly what [Jones] did.”279

“RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT”
What they couldn’t achieve through Kyoto they tried to achieve through cap
and trade legislation. And what they couldn’t achieve through legislation,
they are currently trying to achieve through regulation.

In the midst of the cap and trade debate, as support for the bill was
dwindling, the Obama EPA was working behind the scenes to finalize a
“finding” that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare, known as the
“endangerment finding.” During a key case, Massachusetts v. EPA,280 the
Supreme Court ruled that if EPA determined that greenhouse gases endanger
human health, then they must regulate them under the Clean Air Act. The key
word here is “if.” Proponents of the endangerment finding claim that the court
forced the EPA to move forward with this finding, but this is not the case.
The courts were clear that the EPA Administrator first had to determine if
greenhouse gases endanger the public, and that determination would require a
scientific investigation. They had a choice, and they made the wrong choice.
They chose to make an endangerment finding based on the flawed scientific
conclusions of the IPCC.

As the cap and trade battle waged on, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson
and President Obama said repeatedly that passing the bill was preferable
because EPA regulations would be much more costly and complicated. As
one astute April 2009 editorial in the Wall Street Journal put it, the
Administration essentially played Russian roulette with regulations:

President Obama’s global warming agenda has been losing support in
Congress, but why let an irritant like democratic consent interfere with

saving the world? So last Friday the Environmental Protection Agency
decided to put a gun to the head of Congress and play cap and trade
roulette with the U.S. economy.

The pistol comes in the form of a ruling that carbon dioxide is a
dangerous pollutant that threatens the public and therefore must be
regulated under the 1970 Clean Air Act. This so-called ‘endangerment
finding’ sets the clock ticking on a vast array of taxes and regulation that
EPA will have the power to impose across the economy, and all with
little or no political debate.281

They were determined to have cap and trade no matter what.
Part of the reason EPA regulation of greenhouse gases would be more

complicated is that the Clean Air Act thresholds are only meant to regulate
real, localized pollutants such as SO2, NOX, and Mercury. Numerous legal
experts, including Democrat Representative John Dingell, who wrote the
Clean Air Act amendments, have said that the Clean Air Act was never
designed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. That’s because emissions of
greenhouse gases are far greater than conventional pollutants, if EPA
regulated them at the thresholds required by the Clean Air Act, the Agency
would have to regulate almost everything including schools, hospitals,
nursing homes, commercial buildings, churches, restaurants, hotels, malls,
colleges and universities, food processing facilities, farms, sports arenas,
soda manufacturers, bakers, brewers, wineries, and even some private
homes. The results of that would be absurd, so EPA tailored the Clean Air
Act to create much higher thresholds for greenhouse gases—but this tailoring
will not likely hold up in the courts because it directly contradicts the law.
And if the courts throw the “tailoring rule” out, it will be as Representative
John Dingell put it, “a glorious mess.”282

And the entire foundation of this bureaucratic nightmare is flawed

science: EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson admitted to me publicly that EPA
based its action on the IPCC science, saying that the proposal, the Agency
relied in large part on the assessment reports developed by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

At an Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on December 2,

2009, I challenged Administrator Jackson on that matter, saying that given

what has come to light in the Climategate scandal, EPA should halt this
agenda. She replied, “While I would absolutely agree that these emails show
a lack of interpersonal skills, as I would say to my kids, be careful who you
write, and maybe more, I have not heard anything that causes me to believe
that that overwhelming consensus that climate change is happening and that
man-made emissions are contributing to it, have changed.”283 At an
Environment and Public Works Committee hearing in February 2010,
Administrator Jackson told me that EPA accepted the findings of the IPCC
without any serious, independent analysis.284

Directly in line with Administrator Jackson’s points, the endangerment

finding states, “it is EPA’s view that the scientific assessments” of the IPCC
“represent the best reference materials for determining the general state of
knowledge of the scientific and technical issues before the agency in making
an endangerment decision.”285 In the finding’s Technical Support Document
(TSD), in the section on “attribution,” EPA claims that climate changes are
the result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and not natural forces.
In this section EPA has 67 citations, 47 of which refer to the IPCC.286

If there are any objective readers of this book who still give credibility to

the IPCC science on which the entire hoax is based and the basis of the
endangerment finding, then reading Appendix C is a must.

DR. ALAN CARLIN
Rewind for a moment to March 9, 2009, when Dr. Alan Carlin, a PhD
economist in EPA’s Office of Policy, Economics, and Innovation released a
key report that called into question the scientific process underlying the
agency’s proposed endangerment finding. According to Carlin, a thirty-eight-
year veteran of EPA, and a fellow agency employee:

We have become increasingly concerned that EPA and many other
agencies and countries have paid too little attention to the science of
global warming. EPA and others have tended to accept the findings
reached by outside groups, particularly the IPCC and the CCSP, as being
correct without a careful and critical examination of their conclusion and
documentation…We believe our concerns and reservations are
sufficiently important to warrant a serious review of the science by EPA
before any attempt is made to reach conclusions on the subject.287

But Carlin’s request was denied. In a series of emails, Al McGartland,
Carlin’s boss, forbade him from having “any direct communication” with
anyone outside of his office concerning his study. On March 16, Carlin tried
again, but McGartland made clear what his superiors thought of the report:
“The time for such discussion of fundamental issues has passed for this
round. The administrator and the [Obama] administration have decided to
move forward on endangerment, and your comments do not help the legal or
policy case for this decision… I can only see one impact of your comments
given where we are in the process, and that would be a very negative impact
on our office.” But that wasn’t all. McGartland also wrote to Carlin: “With
the endangerment finding nearly final, you need to move on to other issues
and subjects. I don’t want you to spend any additional EPA time on climate
change. No papers, no research etc., at least until we see what EPA is going
to do with Climate.”288 So much for transparency.

The endangerment finding was finalized December 7, 2009, just in time

for the Copenhagen climate conference.289 Cap and trade had failed, but
President Obama could still face world leaders armed with his backup plan.
The cost of “doing something” for the conference was high: the endangerment
finding, like cap and trade would cost American consumers around $300 to
$400 billion a year, significantly raise energy prices, and destroy hundreds of
thousands of jobs.

CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE IPCC
After Climategate there was an interesting reversal in the mainstream media:
all those outlets that had praised Al Gore and the IPCC to the heights just a
few years prior were suddenly tearing apart the IPCC’s assessments—and
more and more and more flaws came to light. When ABC News,290 the
Economist,291 Time,292 Newsweek,293 and the Financial Times294 —among
many others—reported that the IPCC’s research contains embarrassing flaws,
and that the IPCC chairman and scientists knew of the flaws, but published
them anyway—well, you have the makings of a major scientific scandal. In
the end, well over a hundred different errors in the IPCC science were
revealed in the wake of the Climategate email scandal.

One of the most publicized errors was, of course, IPCC’s claim that the

Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. It’s simply false, yet it was put into
the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment report. Here’s what we know:

•      According to the Telegraph, “the IPCC [has] since admitted it was

based on a report written in a science journal and even the scientist who
was the subject of the original story admits it was not based on facts.”295

•      “When finally published,” the Telegraph wrote, “the IPCC report did

give its source as the WWF study but went further, suggesting the
likelihood of the glaciers melting was ‘very high’.” (The IPCC, by the
way, defines this as having a probability of greater than 90%.)296

Time magazine, the very publication that once told us to be afraid— very
afraid of global warming, said that “Glaciergate,” was a “black eye for the
IPCC and for the climate-science community as a whole.”297

There was more. According to the Telegraph, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the

head of the IPCC, “was informed that claims about melting Himalayan
glaciers were false before the Copenhagen summit.298

So why was the Himalayan error included? We now know from the very
IPCC scientist who edited the report’s section on Asia that it was done for
political purposes—it was inserted to induce China, India, and other
countries to “take action” on global warming. According to the UK’s Sunday
Mail, Murari Lal, the scientist in charge of the IPCC’s chapter on Asia, said
“We thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policymakers and
politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action.” In other
words, as the Sunday Mail wrote, Lal “admitted [the glacier alarmism] was
included purely to put political pressure on world leaders.”299

So what had the IPCC done to rectify this fiasco? I went into the IPCC
report to see if a correction had been made: the 2035 claim was still there.
Of course, there was a note attached and it said the following:

It has, however, recently come to our attention that a paragraph in the
938-page Working Group II contribution to the underlying assessment
refers to poorly substantiated estimates of rate of recession and date for
the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers. In drafting the paragraph in
question, the clear and well-established standards of evidence, required
by the IPCC procedures, were not applied properly.300

It turns out that the IPCC’s fourth assessment also found observed

reductions in mountain ice in the Andes, Alps, and Africa—all caused by, of
course, global warming. In an article titled, “UN climate change panel based
claims on student dissertation and magazine article,” the Telegraph reported:

… one of the sources quoted was a feature article published in a popular
magazine for climbers which was based on anecdotal evidence from
mountaineers about the changes they were witnessing on the
mountainsides around them. The other was a dissertation written by a
geography student, studying for the equivalent of a master’s degree, at the
University of Berne in Switzerland that quoted interviews with mountain
guides in the Alps.301

On top of this, we found that the IPCC was exaggerating claims about the

Amazon. The report said that 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest was
endangered by global warming. But, again, as we’ve seen, this was taken
from, yes, a study by the World Wildlife Federation, and one that had nothing
to do with global warming. Even worse, it was written by a green activist.

In the wake of the scandal, even my good friend Barbara Boxer was

careful about how she talked about the IPCC. As she said in a hearing on
EPA’s Budget on February 23, 2010, “In my opening statement, I didn’t quote
one international scientist or IPCC report…We are quoting the American
scientific community here.”

This was the “gold standard” of climate research; it was the body that was

awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. It obviously did not win a Nobel
science award.

ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
This crisis of confidence in the IPCC translates to a crisis of confidence for
EPA’s endangerment finding, which rests in large measure on the IPCC’s
conclusions. The endangerment finding’s scientific foundation has already
disintegrated and I believe it will only be a matter of time before the finding
itself follows suit.

Once I had it confirmed from Lisa Jackson that the EPA had relied on the
science of the IPCC to establish the endangerment finding, I asked the EPA
Office of Inspector General (OIG) in April 2010 to investigate the process

leading up to the endangerment finding to determine if EPA had come to that
conclusion properly. In September 2011, the OIG completed its report and
found that the EPA had not come to this conclusion properly—in fact, it found
that the scientific assessment underpinning the Obama EPA’s endangerment
finding for greenhouse gasses was inadequate and in violation of the
Agency’s own peer review process.302 The report calls the scientific
integrity of EPA’s decision-making process into question and undermines the
credibility of the endangerment finding.

The Inspector General’s investigation uncovered that the EPA failed to

engage in the required record-keeping process leading up to the
endangerment finding decision, and it also did not follow its own peer
review procedures to ensure that the science behind the decision was sound.
Regardless of what one thinks of the UN science, the EPA is still required—
by its own procedures—to conduct an independent review. Dr. Alan Carlin
is now vindicated as his concerns that EPA was relying too much on the
science of the IPCC, and that the Agency was not engaging in a rigorous
scientific process, turned out to be valid.

I was reminded of Jon Stewart’s warning “don’t cut corners!” when the

press began weighing in on the IG report. The headline from the AP was
“U.S. watchdog: EPA Took Shortcut on Climate Finding.”303 EPA
immediately responded saying, as it did during the Climategate scandal, that
this still does not affect the validity of the science, but Stewart’s admonition
of the scientists of Climategate applies to the EPA: if the Agency is so sure
the science is completely sound, why did they cut corners? Why can’t they be
transparent if there is nothing to hide?

EPA’s process to determine the endangerment finding was rushed, biased,

and appears to have been predetermined. Now that all of this has come to
light, the only conclusion is that the endangerment finding should be thrown
out, and if it is, it will be a tremendous victory for the American people.

COPENHAGEN

Speaking to reporters in Copenhagen

BACK INTO THE LION’S DEN
I was only in Copenhagen for three hours but they were the most exhilarating
three hours of my political life.

I landed at 7 a.m. on a particularly frigid morning to be holding a

conference on global warming. Because I was coming to Copenhagen as a
Senator in the minority party, on my own, and not part of any Congressional
Delegation, the UN Climate Conference would not give me a meeting room to
visit with UN officials or hold a press conference. But with the President
planning to make an appearance, over one hundred members of the press
were locked in a press room so I saw the perfect opportunity to deliver my

message. There was a staircase at the front of the press room which gave me
the best vantage point. Nothing was going on at the time: Al Gore and
Senator John Kerry had just left—so even if the press wasn’t very happy to
see me, at least my visit was some news. I know it sounds strange to say it
but the experience was really quite enjoyable. I will always remember all
those people in the room—hundreds of them—and all the cameras. And they
all had one thing in common: they all hated me.

Fox News had it right when they said I had just walked into the “lion’s

den”:

Inhofe is the second member of congress to arrive in Copenhagen. Kerry
addressed reporters last night and got a standing ovation inside the Bella
Convention Center. By contrast, Inhofe was mobbed inside the press
center and was not offered a speaking slot…Surrounded by reporters
from around the world, including many who believe global warming is
real, Inhofe often looked like a lamb on his way to slaughter.304

I was just happy to see that I had maintained my distinction of being the
“most dangerous man on the planet” after all these years. As Der Spiegel
would later write:

He only came for a few hours, but he was also decisively responsible for
the chaos that marked the negotiations: James Inhofe, a Republican
politician who does whatever he can in Washington to inhibit Obama’s
efforts to impose CO2 limits. He is not only ridiculous in describing
climate change as made up by “the Hollywood elite,” but outright
dangerous…Men like Inhofe, who in Copenhagen warned that nations
shouldn’t be “deceived into thinking the US would pass cap and trade
legislation,” have the effect of poison when it comes to the urgently
needed global trust-building.305

I still find it amazing that they thought me capable of single-handedly

destroying the planet.

ONE-MAN TRUTH SQUAD

Leading up to the conference, President Obama was trying to make it sound
like there was still hope that the United States would act on global warming.
On September 22, 2009, he made a point to highlight the efforts of cap and
trade legislation in Congress as if that were going to lead to something:

The House of Representatives passed an energy and climate bill in June
that would finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy for
American businesses and dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
One committee has already acted on this bill in the Senate and I look
forward to engaging with others as we move forward.306

But by November 17, 2009, Wall Street Journal said it best in their

editorial entitled, “Copenhagen’s Collapse—The Climate Change Sequel Is a
Bust”:

“Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,” President-
elect Obama said of global warming last November. “Delay is no longer
an option.” It turns out that delay really is an option-the only one that has
world-wide support. Over the weekend Mr. Obama bowed to reality and
admitted that little of substance will come of the climate-change summit
in Copenhagen next month. For the last year the President has been
promising a binding international carbon-regulation treaty a la the Kyoto
Protocol, but instead negotiators from 192 countries now hope to reach a
preliminary agreement that they’ll sign such a treaty when they meet in
Mexico City in 2010. No doubt. The environmental lobby is blaming
Copenhagen’s pre-emptive collapse on the Senate’s failure to ram
through a cap and trade scheme like the House did in June, arguing that
“the world” won’t make commitments until the U.S. does. But there will
always be one excuse or another, given that developing countries like
China and India will never be masochistic enough to subject their
economies to the West’s climate neuroses. Meanwhile, Europe has
proved with Kyoto that the only emissions quotas it will accept are those
that don’t actually have to be met.307

Then as Anna Fifield of the Financial Times put it in a story called “U.S.

Senator Calls Global Warming a Hoax,” on December 5, 2009, even
President Obama had “conceded that the Copenhagen summit is not going to

result in a binding international treaty.”308 Yet he was still planning to
commit the United States to a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions from 2005 levels by 2020, which were the cuts prescribed in the
Waxman-Markey bill.

The President was clearly in a difficult position. He had failed even to
bring together his own party in the Senate to pass the cap and trade bill, so
there was no chance he would bring the world together to implement an
international treaty as he had once promised. For weeks there was plenty of
speculation as to whether President Obama would even attend in person due
to the fact that the effort was going to fail, but just days before the conference
we learned that the President would indeed be traveling to Copenhagen to
commit the United States to emissions cuts and deliver billions of taxpayer
dollars to the global warming effort.

I had the opportunity to debate the President’s plan with Ed Markey on

FOX News Sunday with Chris Wallace the weekend before the Conference:

CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: Senator Inhofe, in Copenhagen, the
president is reportedly going to pledge the U.S. will reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 17 percent by the year 2020 and will contribute billions
of dollars to developing countries to help them reduce their emissions.
How much authority will the president’s pledge have?

SEN. JAMES INHOFE, (R-OK): Well, see, Chris, that’s the reason I’m
going, to make sure people in these other 191 countries know the
president can’t do that.

The initial reductions he’s talking about are what you find in Markey’s
bill, and that isn’t going to happen. And of course, that bill’s dead. It will
never even be brought up again.

And on top of that, he’s going to commit, I understand, to some $10

billion a year to the developing countries. Now, here’s China that holds
$800 billion of our debt and we’re going to give them $10 billion to stop
generating electricity? I don’t think that’s going to happen. Representative
Markey, however, was in denial. As he said:

REP. ED MARKEY, (D-MA): So as the president goes there, based
upon the Waxman-Markey bill, which has passed through the House of
Representatives, which is a 17 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by
2020—the bill that’s already passed through the Senate Environment
Committee, which is also a 17 to 20 percent reduction, combined with all
of the other activity that Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Joe
Lieberman, Senator John Kerry…

WALLACE: Yeah, but none of this has passed.

MARKEY: Senator Susan Collins are all moving towards, there is real
momentum now building for a bipartisan bill to pass through the United
States Senate.309

Especially after that interview, I felt that I needed to travel to

Copenhagen, as the left was in full media spin cycle and clearly in denial.
But as I had predicted in a New York Times article in November, Senate
votes were scheduled on the healthcare bill conveniently at the time of the
Copenhagen conference, so that cast doubt on the attendance of any senators.
Senator Boxer cancelled her trip and instead gave a video address to the
conference. Given the significance of the votes on the healthcare bill and
believing my colleagues would not attend, I met with the rest of my Truth
Squad and we decided to cancel.

However, I found out later that Senator Kerry was going to sneak over to
the conference after all. Once I heard that, I knew I had to be there as well
because Senator Kerry would not tell them the truth. I immediately booked a
flight that would have me on the ground in Copenhagen for only three hours. I
scheduled it so that my message could be delivered and still be back in
Washington in time for some key votes.

And as I predicted, Senator Kerry claimed in an interview that I was

wrong and cap and trade still had a shot:

REPORTER: Senator Inhofe’s staff are here meeting with a number of
foreign delegations. He’s coming tomorrow. He’s giving a lot of
interviews to foreign media saying essentially this is going to be a repeat
of Kyoto, that we cannot pass this.

SENATOR KERRY: Well he’s wrong, he’s just dead wrong. He’s
wrong. We have a president of the United States that isn’t George Bush,
and we have a Senate that doesn’t reflect Senator Inhofe’s view. Senator
Inhofe does not accept the science.

REPORTER: But how might the rest of the world take that message?

SENATOR KERRY: I think everybody understands there are doubters
and skeptics and there are people, as I said, who accept the science. The
vast majority of people in the world who understand the science accept
it. And they want action. I don’t think he represents the majority. What he
represents is the fight that we have over these issues but I don’t think he
represents the majority on this issue.

REPORTER: The latest numbers show that people don’t believe—in
America—that this is as much a problem as they’ve been led to believe.
And that they don’t want to have to change the way they live…those
numbers are going south.

SENATOR KERRY: You don’t have to change the way you live.
Nobody is suggesting… nobody has to give up any comfort. Nobody has
to change the way they live. They can live better. They can live safer, live
healthier, live with more income in their household, live with less money
going to wasteful energy. This is a better road for the creation of jobs and
the security of our country and I believe that, again, that most Americans
understand that.310

Senator Kerry’s statement is interesting not only because it turned out that

he was the one who was “dead wrong” about cap and trade, but because it
also clearly exemplifies the crisis of messaging from which the global
warming alarmists continually suffered. It was almost impossible to keep
track of all the different ways global warming was sold: first they told us that
the planet was warming to a dangerous degree and we were going to be
wiping sweat off our brows in the middle of February; then the message was
that cold weather and every weather event was due to global warming; then
Al Gore asked us in his movie if we were ready to change the way we live,
while the Hollywood elite went on an extensive campaign to tell us to take

public transportation, avoid planes and cars, and change our light bulbs; then
the debate was no longer about saving the world but about transitioning to a
clean energy economy, achieving energy security, and reducing pollution;
then in one desperate final attempt, Senator Kerry tells us that we don’t have
to change the way we live or give up any comfort. In fact, according to
Senator Kerry, cap and trade will make us a more prosperous nation.

While my environmental friends changed their tune constantly throughout
the years to justify imposing the largest tax increase in American history, and
as each one of their rhetorical tactics failed with the American people, my
message has been exactly the same from the very beginning: the science is not
settled; their solutions—whether they be Kyoto, cap and trade, or global
warming regulations by the EPA—are only symbolic and will only be all
economic pain for no environmental gain; and as I said first in Milan and
again in Copenhagen, the United States would never ratify Kyoto or impose
cap and trade. On the steps of the press room, I told them the same thing I’ve
been saying all along:

I want to turn back the clock to December 2003, when the United Nations
convened the “9th Conference of the Parties” in Milan, Italy, to discuss
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. At the time, I was leading the
Senate delegation to Milan as Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works. Fast forward to December 2009: the UN
is holding its 15th global warming conference-and the delegates are
haggling over the same issues that were before them in 2003. I know this
because I was there. Recently, with the Copenhagen talks underway, I
reread the speech I delivered in Milan. I found that the issues at stake in
2003 are nearly the same as those in 2009. In short, nothing has changed
and nothing has been done.

So let’s go back to 2003. In my speech, I told the conference that the

Senate would not ratify Kyoto. Here’s what I said: “The Senate, by a vote
of 95 to 0, approved the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which warned the
President against signing a treaty that would either economically harm the
United States or exempt developing countries from participating.” I went
on to say this: “Both those conditions then, and still to this day, have not
been satisfied. So, it’s worth noting that even if President Bush wanted to
submit the treaty to the Senate, it couldn’t be ratified.” That was 2003.

Is that still true today? Of course it is. And yet here we go again:
China, India, and other developing countries want nothing to do with
absolute, binding emissions cuts. China and India have pledged to reduce
the rate of growth, or intensity, of their emissions. But that’s not
acceptable to the US Senate. Moreover, China is opposed to a mandatory
verification regime to prove it is actually honoring its commitments.

[…]

My stated reason for attending Copenhagen was to make certain the

191 countries attending COP-15 would not be deceived into thinking the
US would pass cap and trade legislation. That won’t happen. And for the
sake of the American people, and the economic well-being of America,
that’s a good thing.311

I may have been the most hated man at the conference, but I was the only
one that was willing to tell them the truth. As I joked later on Wolf Blitzer’s
show, “They’re in the middle of kind of a group therapy right now.”312

LEAVING THEIR FOOTPRINT
In the end, President Obama’s “agreement” was one that did not bind the
United States to any new targets or timelines, with no way to verify or
enforce any type of emission cuts. The entire effort had failed, and that was a
victory for the American people.

But as CBS reported, the United States made its mark in other ways:

Few would argue with the U.S. having a presence at the Copenhagen
Climate Summit. But wait until you hear what we found about how many
in Congress got all-expense paid trips to Denmark on your dime. CBS
investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson reports that cameras spotted
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the summit. She called the shots on who
got to go. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and embattled Chairman
of the Tax Committee Charles Rangel were also there…

Senator Inhofe (R-OK) is one of the few who provided us any detail.

He attended the summit on his own for just a few hours, to give an
“opposing view.” “They’re going because it’s the biggest party of the

year,” Sen. Inhofe said. “The worst thing that happened there is they ran
out of caviar.”

Nobody we asked would defend the super-sized Congressional

presence on camera. One Democrat said it showed the world the U.S. is
serious about climate change. And all those attendees who went to the
summit rather than hooking up by teleconference? They produced enough
climate-stunting carbon dioxide to fill 10,000 Olympic swimming pools.
Which means even if Congress didn’t get a global agreement—they left
an indelible footprint all the same.313

THE ATTEMPTS TO RAISE CAP AND TRADE

FROM THE GRAVE

“One of the things I don’t think happens often enough in our society in part
because it doesn’t happen so often that we have public figures who stand up
who set their feet squarely forward and say this is nonsense. We have to be
fact based, we have to be rational and this nonsense has to end. James Inhofe
has been such a man over the past six to seven years. He sometimes stood
absolutely alone and was demonized, vilified, ridiculed by the national
media. He stands now in 2010 as a man utterly vindicated.”

—Lou Dobbs, February 24, 2010314

BY THE END OF 2009, cap and trade was dead and buried with so many nails
in the coffin, yet Senator Kerry, Senator Graham, and Senator Lieberman still
got their shovels out and started trying to dig it out in a fruitless attempt to
resurrect the bill.

In November 2009, even as Senator Boxer was marking up in Committee
her version of cap and trade, Kerry-Boxer, without any Republicans, Senator
Kerry was already in talks about introducing a separate cap and trade bill—
he called it a “dual track” measure.315 He undoubtedly saw the writing on the
wall that Kerry-Boxer was failing and he didn’t want to go to the UN
Copenhagen climate conference without a Plan B. So while Obama faced
national leaders with the endangerment finding in hand, Kerry came armed
with the promise of a bill that he would unveil with Senators Graham and
Lieberman. On December 10, 2009, the three presented not their bill but the
framework for a bill316 —it sounded just like the process for Kerry-Boxer.
They were trying to distract the public with multiple bills in a “smoke and
mirrors” campaign. Here we go again.

This tripartisan trio’s plan was to implement the same targets as the

Waxman-Markey bill: a 17 percent reduction by 2020. Their strategy right
away was to say that this was the “last call” before regulations would set in.
Of course, President Obama and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson often
reminded us that regulations under the Clean Air Act would be much worse
than a cap and trade bill. Senators Kerry and Graham echoed this point in a
joint New York Times op-ed:

Failure to act comes with another cost. If Congress does not pass
legislation dealing with climate change, the administration will use the
Environmental Protection Agency to impose new regulations. Imposed
regulations are likely to be tougher and they certainly will not include the
job protections and investment incentives we are proposing.

The message to those who have stalled for years is clear: killing a

Senate bill is not success; indeed, given the threat of agency regulation,
those who have been content to make the legislative process grind to a
halt would later come running to Congress in a panic to secure the kinds
of incentives and investments we can pass today. Industry needs the
certainty that comes with Congressional action.317

And, as with Kerry-Boxer, they didn’t want to call it cap and trade, even

though that’s exactly what it was. As Steve Benen of the Washington
Monthly aptly put it:

Apparently, “cap and trade” no longer polls well. The White House
seems to now prefer “energy independence legislation.” These three
senators are using the phrase “market-based approach.” (“You remember
the artist formerly known as Prince?” Lieberman said. “This is the
market-based system for punishing polluters previously known as ‘cap
and trade.’”)318
More “smoke and mirrors.” Months later, Senator Reid reinforced this
statement saying that even though the bill does create caps on greenhouse
gases, he doesn’t like the term “cap and trade.” As he said, “We don’t use the
word ‘cap and trade.’ That’s something that’s been deleted from my
dictionary. Carbon pricing is the right term.”319

While Kerry-Boxer was branded as a “pollution reduction bill,” Kerry-
Graham-Lieberman was going to be “energy independence legislation” that
will “punish polluters”—only the polluters would not be punished; even by
President Obama’s own admission, it would be the American people who
would be punished. When the President said himself that under his plan of a
cap and trade system “electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket” he
explained that it was because power plants “would have to retro-fit their
operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to the
consumers.”320 No wonder they didn’t like to say cap and trade.

In fact, not only would the “polluters” not be punished, they were cutting

some pretty good deals for themselves.

THE APPEASERS
When I think of all the backroom deals that took place during the Waxman-
Markey and Kerry-Graham-Lieberman days, the maxim that comes to mind
is: “No man survives when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, And
those who cry, ‘appease, appease’ Are hanged by those they tried to please”
(Hiram Mann).

I remember so well the Hillary healthcare push of 1993—it was the first

attempt to impose socialized medicine. As I was flying back from D.C.
through Chicago, I was so pleased we had virtually won the fight and
defeated Hillary Care. I was on the plane reading the Wall Street Journal
where I saw a full page ad by the American Medical Association embracing
Hillary Care. Needless to say, I called the AMA from Chicago. They were
appeasing the enemy.

And the same thing was happening with many of the energy providers

during the cap and trade push.

Democrats were always so pleased with themselves when the corporate

heavyweights would come to the table, but I maintained that there was no
way they were doing this out of the goodness of their hearts or because they
wanted to be good stewards of the environment. They were in this because
they knew that they could profit if they played their cards right—and the
American consumer would have to foot the bill.

During the Waxman-Markey days, many of the utility companies thought

cap and trade was inevitable with Democrats controlling both houses of

Congress and the White House. So instead of fighting against the bill because
it was bad for jobs and the economy, they started negotiating with the enemy:
they were appeasers. But as what always happens to the appeasers, they are,
as the saying goes, hanged by those they try to please. And of course, that’s
exactly what happened in the deals that were made with Waxman-Markey.
One of the reasons they wanted to negotiate was because they felt that

regulations under legislation would be at least somewhat better than
regulations by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. They also wanted to get a
good deal on the allocation of carbon credits, which were limited. But in the
end, the electric utilities didn’t get what they wanted in the Waxman-Markey
bill—it sold the utilities short. And even worse, the Waxman-Markey bill did
not fully take away the threat of EPA regulations. It did have language to
restrict EPA’s ability to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for
greenhouse gases but this restriction was on a limited time frame so it left the
door open for both legislation and EPA regulations.

When various companies came to the Senate to shop amendments, I said

the last thing I wanted to do was improve the bill. I wanted to kill the bill, so
I wasn’t much use to them.

Especially during Kerry’s last cap and trade push, many of the utilities,

which primarily used natural gas and nuclear energy as opposed to coal, saw
cap and trade as inevitable. When they realized that coal was getting some
extra provisions in the form of a mill tax to support clean coal technologies,
they wanted to carve out as many allowances as they could. Now no one is a
bigger supporter of natural gas and nuclear energy than I am; I truly believe
we need it all, so I told them that coal may be on the chopping block now—
as it was the industry that cap and trade proponents’ ultimately sought to
destroy—but you’ll be next.

So when the next Kerry-Graham-Lieberman proposal came along, I asked

these appeasers: do you think a cap and trade bill is good for the economy,
good for your members, good for workers, good for consumers? Don’t forget
what happened with Waxman-Markey: some utilities thought they had a deal,
but when the language was actually drafted, the deal made Waxman and
Markey happy, but not the utilities.

During the Kerry-Graham-Lieberman debate, one of the biggest

appeasers, as many will be surprised to realize was an oil company, BP. The
trio had what they thought was a clever plan to get Republicans over to their

side: they were going to put in provisions that would encourage offshore
drilling for oil and gas, increase nuclear power capacity, and encourage
clean coal technologies—and the promise of deals would bring industry to
the table. It was a classic divide and conquer strategy—a strategy that was
destined for failure because whenever you get votes on one side by using
these tactics, you always lose votes on the other side. Besides, even if you
were for offshore drilling, you still couldn’t get away from the fact that any
cap and trade bill would just mean more dependence on foreign oil, more
taxes, and fewer jobs. At the same time, President Obama’s FY budget
planned to impose well over $40 billion in new taxes on the oil and gas
industry, which would only discourage production.

The worst part about Kerry-Graham-Lieberman was that on top of the

higher electricity prices it would force on consumers, it also contained a gas
tax. This gas tax was supported by none other than BP and it was a great deal
for them:321 the American consumer, not the company, would be footing the
bill for this greenhouse gas regime—the same consumers were suffering from
high unemployment. A new tax was the last thing they needed. When it
became clear that the bill contained a gas tax, the Kerry-Graham-Lieberman
house of cards came tumbling down. The White House came out opposing it
and blamed the idea on Senator Graham.322 The sponsors and supporters of
the bill were left trying to explain how legislation that raises the cost of
gasoline for consumers, isn’t really a tax.

On April 19, 2010, I spoke with Jeanne Cummings of Politico about

Kerry, Graham, and Lieberman’s latest cap and trade effort.323 Jeanne
specifically focused on the Democrats’ aggressive effort to bring the energy
development industries to the table and asked if the trio will be successful
this time given that the deals they are offering were more generous now than
ever. I said that their strategy is flawed. They’ve tried it before and it didn’t
work: it’s called “divide and conquer” when they go to the various oil, gas,
nuclear, and coal industries and carve out special deals. I said that the
problem with that is you may be able to get some votes that way but you will
lose votes on the other side. At that time, ten Democrats had already signed a
letter telling the bill’s sponsors that if they add an offshore drilling provision
they will no longer support the bill. So with offshore drilling, they might pick
up four votes on one side but they lose ten on the other. I said that it would be

something that they’ll introduce on Earth Day and have a big celebration and
then it will fade away quickly.

Only a few days after my interview with Jeanne Cummings, BP, the

company that was supposed to help make the bill successful, was the very
company responsible for the oil spill that began in April 2010. Not
surprisingly, the provisions planned for expanding offshore drilling were
immediately abandoned and then an interesting shift in rhetoric took place:
whereas initially increasing offshore drilling was going to be a tool to help
pass the bill, after the spill, the message was that we had to pass this bill to
stop offshore drilling altogether.

In the wake of the spill, President Obama announced that now was the

time to put a price on carbon.324 People had died, people’s economic
livelihoods were at stake, and the environment was being harmed, yet the
President was taking this opportunity to push cap and trade. That’s when
President Obama began his moratorium on deepwater drilling—something
that environmental groups have sought for years. It was an exercise in
overreach that would do far more harm than good. The Louisiana Department
of Economic Development was estimating that thousands of good paying jobs
would be killed in the moratorium’s wake. It was a time when we should
have been concentrating on putting a cap on the spill, not putting a cap on the
economy.

After the drilling provisions were taken out, Senator Graham could no

longer support the bill—so their divide and conquer strategy even lost them a
former sponsor. The bill that was, from then on, known as Kerry-Lieberman
was well on its way to failure.

Whereas Jeanne Cummings of Politico wanted to know if cap and trade
had a better shot with the drilling provisions, Stuart Varney of Fox News, in
an interview in May 2010, wanted to know if the bill had a better shot now
that drilling provisions had been taken out. I said no, it is still dead and for
the same reasons. Without the drilling provisions, they would just lose those
members who supported offshore drilling and they’d be right back where
they started.

The reaction from the environmental community to the spill in the Gulf

was not unlike their reaction during the time of the Exxon-Valdez incident in
1989. At that time, I was serving on two committees in the U.S. House of
Representatives that investigated the oil spill. Four days after the tragedy, I

spoke to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington and was taken aback
by environmental activists who were celebrating. They were saying that they
were glad the accident happened because they could parley this tragedy into
stopping development and exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. The same thing was happening with the BP oil spill: they were trying
to parley this into killing all kinds of offshore drilling. Of course, the Exxon-
Valdez incident was a transportation accident, and decreasing offshore
production would only increase our dependence on foreign oil, which would
increase transportation of oil and therefore increase the possibility of another
oil spill. But that wasn’t the point—they just want to stop drilling altogether.

To all those who still after all this time thought that cap and trade was

inevitable, I reminded them that opposition has only grown stronger and more
intense. They could have all the backroom secret deals they wanted to try to
get to sixty votes, but try as they might, it was never going work. If we look
back on the votes in the Senate, it is overwhelmingly clear that support for
cap and trade over that time has dropped considerably. In 2003, they got
forty-three; in 2005, they got thirty-eight; and in 2008, with Lieberman-
Warner, they got forty-eight. But let’s not forget that just after the cloture vote
on Lieberman-Warner, ten Democrats, nine of whom voted for cloture, very
quickly sent a letter stating that they could not vote for Lieberman-Warner “in
its current form.” So subtract nine, and you get thirty-nine votes. That’s a far
cry from sixty. There was no way Kerry-Lieberman was going to pass.

CAP AND TRADE IS DEAD BUT THE ENDANGERMENT
FINDING IS ALIVE AND WELL
Later in June, even as Kerry and Lieberman were still trying to dig cap and
trade out of the grave, the attention began to shift to stopping EPA’s
greenhouse gas regulations from taking effect.

Here’s where the idea of playing “Russian roulette” with regulations, as

the Wall Street Journal brilliantly pointed out a year earlier, comes in.
Democrats’ mantra was the EPA regulations would be so much worse and
much more expensive than legislation. We had managed to kill cap and trade
handily, so now Democrats were going to be responsible for some of the
messiest, most expensive and most onerous regulations in American history.
With elections coming up, many of them were having second thoughts.

As I mentioned before, one of the reasons EPA regulation of the

greenhouse gases would be such a disaster is that the Clean Air Act contains
very specific emissions thresholds for regulated pollutants. Under a program
to maintain air quality, facilities that emit 250 tons or more per year of a
given pollutant must obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or
PSD, permit before they can build or make major modifications to existing
facilities. Two hundred and fifty tons is a big number for traditional
pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide, but not for greenhouse
gases. A large commercial building, for example, emits about 100,000 tons
of CO2 a year. We’re talking about six million sources potentially subject to
EPA regulation. To get around this unmitigated administrative and economic
disaster, EPA just decided to ignore the law by instituting the “tailoring rule.”
That’s right: it randomly decreed that regulations would apply only to
facilities that emit more than 100,000 tons. That threshold would be tweaked
over time and apply to sources at differing stages. But the Clean Air Act is
clear. EPA can’t just change a law clearly laid out by Congress. Two hundred
and fifty tons is two hundred and fifty tons.

What will be the results of this? Imagine heading to church on Sunday to

find the doors locked because it couldn’t afford to install Best Available
Control Technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, EPA
dismisses this and similar examples as nothing more than empty scare tactics.
They contend that they have already exempted smaller entities through the
tailoring rule so no one has to worry.

Not so fast. EPA’s so-called tailoring rule is now being challenged with
several lawsuits. It is very likely that the D.C. Circuit will overturn it and
force EPA to grapple with the regulatory nightmare of its own creation. If the
tailoring rule is thrown out—and almost everything is regulated by the EPA
including farms, churches, coffee shops, and restaurants—what will be the
economic impacts? According to EPA’s own documents, PSD permits cost an
average of $125,120 and impose a burden of 866 hours on the applicant. In
addition, the nation’s largest employers, such as refineries, electric utilities,
and industrial manufacturing facilities, will be forced to install (currently
undefined) best available control technology (BACT) at their plants to
reduce CO2. EPA has also admitted that if the tailoring rule does not hold up
in court, they will have to hire 230,000 new employees and spend an
additional $21 billion to implement their greenhouse gas regime.325

THE MURKOWSKI RESOLUTION AND ROCKEFELLER
COVER VOTES
In June of 2010, Senator Murkowski introduced a resolution that would
prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases under the authority of the
Clean Air Act. The resolution would allow Congress to overturn regulations
from the executive branch by gaining a majority in both the House and the
Senate.

At a press conference to discuss the resolution, several Republicans came
together in opposition to EPA’s greenhouse gas regime, even Senator Graham
who still believed in his heart that man-made greenhouse gases were leading
to catastrophe. I was on the other end of the spectrum as the one who said
that man-made catastrophic global warming is the greatest hoax ever
perpetrated on the American people. Everyone else who was standing up
there with me and Senator Graham were somewhere in between. But we all
agreed on one thing: EPA regulation of greenhouse gases would be a huge
disaster. It would hand the agency the greatest regulatory power in history.

When Senator Murkowski first brought up the idea of a resolution, it

seemed unlikely that she would reach a majority in a Democrat run Senate.
But later it became clear that a lot of members who have elections in 2010 or
2012 wouldn’t want to go back to their constituents and say “Look at me.
Aren’t you proud? I allowed the most massive government take-over of every
aspect of our economy to take place”—and this is not to mention all for
nothing as it would have no impact on the climate.

Of course, after the oil spill, the Democrat talking point was that the

Murkowski resolution was a “Big Oil bailout” that will allow oil companies
such as BP to pollute the air. They were exploiting the tragedy in the Gulf to
advance a political agenda rooted in the belief that fossil fuels are a
destructive nuisance that must be eradicated. And it sees an unrelenting
bureaucracy and regulation as the means of realizing a future without them.
But that belief, if carried out in the form of EPA’s impending greenhouse gas
regulatory regime, will mean a radical change to our way of life—a change
that will mean fewer jobs, fewer American businesses, higher taxes, energy
rationing, and more control of people’s lives by a massive, unforgiving
bureaucracy in Washington. As with healthcare, the Obama Administration,
through the endangerment finding, was and still is on the verge of taking over
yet another facet of our economy. Murkowski’s resolution presented a

fundamental challenge to that view, as it would have prevented EPA from
realizing their radical agenda.

Democrats were clearly in a difficult position: if they overturned EPA
greenhouse gas regulations, it would be a huge blow to President Obama
who would be forced to veto a resolution coming out of a Democrat
controlled Senate; but if they allowed them to go unchallenged, many
Democrats worried that they would lose their jobs. In an effort to avoid an
unpleasant situation for the President, Senator Reid promised moderate
Democrats that they would have the opportunity to vote on a bill sponsored
by Senator Rockefeller, which would provide a two-year delay of EPA’s
regulations if they agreed to vote against Murkowski’s resolution. On June 9,
an article in The Hill explained how things were panning out:

Democratic leaders are scrambling to prevent the Senate from delivering
a stinging slap to President Barack Obama on climate change. They have
offered a vote on a bill they dislike in the hopes of avoiding a loss on
legislation Obama hates. The president is threatening to veto a resolution
from Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) that would ban the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating carbon emissions. But if the
president were forced to use his veto to prevent legislation emerging
from a Congress in which his own party enjoys substantial majorities, it
would be a humiliation for him and for Democrats on Capitol Hill. So
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) and other Democratic leaders
are doing what they can to stop it. They are floating the possibility of
voting on an alternative measure from Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat
from the coal state of West Virginia, which they previously refused to
grant floor time, Senate sources say.326
Seven Democrats took the deal offered to them by Senator Reid and did

not vote for the Murkowski resolution. The vote was on June 10, 2010, and it
was defeated by 47–53. If these seven senators had voted for the motion to
proceed to Senator Murkowski’s resolution, the motion to proceed not only
would have passed, it would have passed handily. The whole plan was
transparent: Democratic leaders, in order to ensure that EPA can
micromanage farms and other sources, had to develop a scheme to give cover
to Democrat members who opposed the EPA takeover. Those seven members
were clearly conflicted. They understood the economic harm that an

unfettered EPA bureaucracy could mean for their constituents: fewer jobs,
more regulations, higher taxes, and a slower economy. But they were
pressured by the president and the base of the Democratic Party—they were
warned against defying the president on one of his top initiatives. So they
turned to the Rockefeller bill as an alternative. It was the two-year delay of
Rockefeller—rather than overturning the endangerment finding—that seemed
more politically acceptable.

On the Republican side, every Republican Senator voted for the

Murkowski Resolution, which means that the Senate Democrats are solely
responsible for whatever regulations the EPA implements. Every lost job,
every closed factory, every increase in utility bills or gasoline prices due to
the EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations are the responsibility of Senate
Democrats.

The defeat of the Murkowski resolution wasn’t the end of the road. I said
that if we ever get a vote on the Rockefeller bill, I trust these seven members
—and possibly others who voted “no” on the motion to proceed to
Murkowski—will vote with their constituents for Rockefeller and against
EPA taking jobs, businesses, and energy out of our struggling economy. Even
with the promise a vote on his two-year delay, Rockefeller voted for the
Murkowski resolution. Interestingly the vote on Rockefeller didn’t come up
until the next Congress when we forced Reid to face the problem again.

“LAST CALL”: 2010 ELECTIONS
With the 2010 election looming, the supporters of cap and trade knew that
Republicans were going to make significant gains in the next Congress and
time was running out. As Senator Kerry put it, it was the “last call” to pass
cap and trade.

The town hall meetings in 2009 and 2010 were not just about the passage
of Obamacare; they were also about cap and trade. In fact, cap and trade is
one of the main reasons that Democrats had so many losses in the House. The
2010 elections also brought an interesting reversal in campaign strategies for
Republicans. While in the 2008 elections, few candidates would dare to
question the science behind man-made catastrophic global warming, in 2010,
many Republicans not only campaigned against cap and trade but also
established themselves strongly as skeptics. Americans voted the global

warming advocates out and the skeptics in. And the same thing is happening
as the 2012 elections approach.

With the Murkowski Resolution, the excuse of many Senators was that

even if they voted to rein in the EPA, the resolution would die in a Democrat-
led House. After the 2010 elections, they could no longer use this excuse.

UPTON-INHOFE: THE ENERGY TAX PREVENTION
ACT OF 2011
In March of 2011, I introduced S.482, the Energy Tax Prevention Act of
2011, along with Congressman Fred Upton, Chairman of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, who has introduced the same bill in the House. Like
the Murkowski Resolution, the Energy Tax Prevention Act stops the Obama
EPA’s backdoor cap and trade regulations from taking effect: it protects jobs
in America’s manufacturing sector; protects consumers from higher energy
costs; puts Congress in charge of the nation’s climate change policies; and
ensures that the public health provisions of the Clean Air Act are preserved.

On February 9, 2011, I was privileged to testify to the House

Subcommittee on Energy and Power on the Energy Tax Prevention Act of
2011. Just as Democrats called the Murkowski resolution the “Big Oil
Bailout,” at the hearing, Representative Henry Waxman (D-California) said
that our bill should be called the “Big Polluter Protection Act.”327 He went
on to say that it would “repeal the only authority the administration has to
protect our health and the environment without providing any alternative.”328
Here we go again. Contrary to Representative Waxman’s claims, our bill
leaves all the essential provisions of the Clean Air Act intact. It simply
prevents the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases which are not harmful to
human health. Imposing energy taxes through EPA’s cap and trade regulations
and blocking economic development won’t make Americans healthier—it
will only mean fewer jobs, a higher cost of living, and less growth and
innovation.

Amy Harder of the National Journal in an article called “Reid Might Be

Forced to Deal with His EPA Problem,” wrote:

It wasn’t supposed to go this way if you’re a Democrat.

The 111th Congress was supposed to enact comprehensive climate
change legislation as President Obama prodded action with looming
carbon rules.

Instead, efforts to price greenhouse-gas emissions collapsed in the

Senate last year and left Obama with his hands tied around his climate-
change regulations.

Obama continues to publicly support the regulations and has punted the

debate down Pennsylvania Avenue to Congress.329

In April 2011, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offered the

Energy Tax Prevention Act as an amendment, which finally forced Reid into
action on allowing a vote on the Rockefeller bill—a two year delay—which
was also offered as an amendment. Senator Max Baucus also joined in the
“cover vote” fray and offered an amendment that stipulates that only the
industries would be regulated and not farms and ranches.

The vote on these amendments was a moment of truth for Obama’s job-

killing greenhouse gas regulations: sixty-four senators voted that day, in
various ways, against EPA’s cap and trade agenda. Each one chose whether
to take the “cover vote” or actually to vote with their constituents for the only
real solution to the problem: the Energy Tax Prevention Act. The other
amendments only delayed or put some limitations on how EPA can regulate.

During the debate, most members publicly aligned themselves with

concerned constituents, especially manufacturers or farmers, who oppose
EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, for
example, wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson in February,
arguing that “any approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions must
recognize the unique situation of energy-intensive manufacturers.” Of course,
EPA’s regulations don’t, and can’t: “It is disconcerting,” the senator wrote,
“that, to my knowledge, the EPA has neither a plan in place nor the authority
to provide these protections to U.S. manufacturing, a sector of the economy
critical to the continued economic recovery of my state and so many
others.”330

Well put. Yet Senator Brown voted against the Energy Tax Prevention Act,

the only solution that would fully address the aforementioned concerns.
Delays, carve-outs, and exemptions won’t solve the underlying problem:

now he and all the others who did not vote to stop EPA will have to explain
why they stood by and let it happen.

I was very pleased that the House handily passed the Upton-Inhofe bill
with overwhelming bipartisan support. In the Senate, we are still ten votes
short, but with sixty-four members sending a clear message to the
administration that the Obama-EPA needs to be reined in, we will continue
fighting. At present, the Senate Democrats have a majority of three, but there
are twenty-three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2012. I call
eleven of those Senators an “endangered species.” Several have announced
they will retire rather than run again. I fully expect to be Chairman of the
Environment and Public Works Committee again and I hope it may just be a
matter of time until we can declare final victory, by stopping EPA from
regulating greenhouse gases.

“CAP AND TRADE IS DEAD. LONG LIVE CAP AND
TRADE”
In November of 2010, they finally admitted what I had been saying since
2003: Senator Kerry conceded that cap and trade is dead and Senator
Lieberman said “whether we like it or not, cap and trade has no chance of
passage in the next Congress…And so we’ve got to find separate ways to go
at it.”331

So, just as Lieberman said, they have since been trying to find separate
ways to go at it—that is, to put a price on carbon. One of these ways has
been to claim that America has been falling behind other nations in the “clean
energy race.” That was exactly the message in President Obama’s State of the
Union address in January 2011. He declared that this is our “Sputnik
moment” and that the same progress that we achieved in space technologies
can be achieved if we invest in clean energy technologies:

This is our generation’s Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we
needed to reach a level of research and development we haven’t seen
since the height of the Space Race. And in a few weeks, I will be sending
a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal. We’ll invest in
biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy
technology—an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our
planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.332

In this speech, the president set the goal of having 80 percent of America’s
electricity come from clean energy sources by 2035 and it later became clear
that he wanted to do this by establishing a “Clean Energy Standard” (CES).
Under a CES, utilities would be required to trade and sell clean energy
credits, increasing the mandate required until 80 percent of electricity needs
are met by clean energy. As is explained in the Obama Administration
Economic Report:

To meet this goal, the Administration is proposing a Clean Energy
Standard (CES) that would require electric utilities to obtain an
increasing share of delivered electricity from clean sources—starting at
the current level of 40 percent and doubling over the next 25 years.
Electricity generators would receive credits for each megawatt-hour of
clean energy generated; utilities with more credits than needed to meet
the standard could sell the credits to other utilities or bank them for future
use.333

This plan was just cap and trade turned inside out, and it was so short

lived that it barely even made the political radar before it was dead—in fact,
it was dead on arrival in Congress. Kim Strassel of the Wall Street Journal
put it well when she wrote just days after the President’s speech:

Listen carefully to Mr. Obama’s speech and you realize he spent plenty of
it on carbon controls. He just used a different vocabulary. If the president
can’t get carbon restrictions via cap and trade, he’ll get them instead with
his new proposal for a “clean energy” standard. Clean energy, after all,
sounds better to the public ear, and he might just be able to lure, or
snooker, some Republicans into going along.334

Of course, President Obama had been pushing this “Sputnik moment”

since the beginning. In his 2009 State of the Union address, he held up China
as an example of how other countries are taking greater strides than the
United States on clean energy:

We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy
will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the
largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient … Well I

do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take
root beyond our borders—and I know you don’t either. It is time for
America to lead again.335

In December 2010, my Environment and Public Works Committee staff

released a report that showed that the so-called “clean energy race” between
the United States and China—and the lament that America is losing—is an
idea concocted by activists to promote cap and trade, renewable energy
mandates, and greater government control of the economy.336 It is premised
on a biased, narrow picture of China’s energy development and the
demonstrably false notion that economic growth and innovation are best
realized through government mandates. If China is embracing anything, it is
the reality that fossil fuels, along with nuclear power, are the engines of
economic growth and prosperity.

Although the CES was gaining no traction whatsoever, President Obama
announced at Penn State that as part of his clean energy push, “So you show
us the best ideas to change your game on the ground; we’ll show you the
money. We will show you the money.”337

Well the solar company, Solyndra, was one of those companies that was

shown the money at the beginning of Obama’s presidency, as it was a
recipient of the stimulus funds under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act. At the time, Solyndra was touted as the model to follow
by the Administration for its green energy economy, and it was hailed as one
of the Recovery Act’s biggest success stories. As President Obama said in a
speech:

When it’s completed in a few months, Solyndra expects to hire a thousand
workers to manufacture solar panels and sell them across America and
around the world […] It’s here that companies like Solyndra are leading
the way toward a brighter and more prosperous future.338

Vice President Joe Biden said that the loan guarantee to Solyndra was an

“unprecedented investment this Administration is making in renewable
energy and exactly what the Recovery Act is all about” and Energy Secretary
Steven Chu said that it was part of “a broad, aggressive effort to spark a new
industrial revolution that will put Americans to work.”339

Now as the country struggles with unemployment and Solyndra has
completely collapsed and gone bankrupt, it is clear that the President’s
policies of “showing the money” has meant throwing the money away. In the
end, Solyndra is more than just a bankrupt company: it is a metaphor for the
failure of Obama’s war on affordable energy and American fossil fuel jobs.

A REAL SOLUTION TO JOBS AND ENERGY SECURITY
In March 2011, in the midst of this “Sputnik moment” clean energy economy
push that was clearly failing, the Congressional Research Service report that
first surfaced in 2009 was updated and it shows us again that America’s
combined recoverable natural gas, oil, and coal endowment is the largest on
Earth. In fact, our recoverable resources are far larger than those of Saudi
Arabia, China, and Canada combined.

While the Obama Administration goes forward with a conscious policy
choice to raise energy prices, accomplished in good measure by restricting
access to domestic energy supplies, we find out that those supplies are,
according to the Congressional Research Service, the largest on Earth.
Here’s what CRS says about America’s tremendous resource base:

Oil
CRS offers a more accurate reflection of America’s substantial oil resources.
While America is often depicted as possessing just 2 or 3 percent of the
world’s oil—a figure which narrowly relies on America’s proven reserves
of just 28 billion barrels—CRS has compiled U.S. government estimates
which show that America, the world’s third-largest oil producer, is endowed
with 163 billion barrels of recoverable oil. That’s enough oil to maintain
America’s current rates of production and replace imports from the Persian
Gulf for more than fifty years.

Natural Gas
Further, CRS notes the 2009 assessment from the Potential Gas Committee,
which estimates America’s future supply of natural gas is 2,047 trillion cubic
feet (TCF)—an increase of more than 25 percent just since the Committee’s
2006 estimate. At today’s rate of use, this is enough natural gas to meet
American demand for ninety years.

Coal
The report also shows that America is number one in coal resources,
accounting for more than 28 percent of the world’s coal. Russia, China, and
India are in a distant second, third, and fifth, respectively. In fact, CRS cites
America’s recoverable coal reserves to be 262 billion short tons. For
perspective, the United States consumes just 1.2 billion short tons of coal per
year. And though portions of this resource may not be accessible or
economically recoverable today, these estimates could ultimately prove to be
conservative. As CRS states: “…U.S. coal resource estimates do not include
some potentially massive deposits of coal that exist in northwestern Alaska.
These currently inaccessible coal deposits have been estimated to be more
than 3,200 billion short tons of coal.”

Oil Shale
While several pilot projects are underway to prove oil shale’s future
commercial viability, the Green River Formation located within Colorado,
Wyoming, and Utah contains the equivalent of 6 trillion barrels of oil. The
Department of Energy estimates that, of this 6 trillion, approximately 1.38
trillion barrels are potentially recoverable. That’s equivalent to more than
five times the conventional oil reserves of Saudi Arabia.

America’s newly tapped shale deposits, such as the Marcellus in

Pennsylvania, the Barnett in Texas, the Haynesville in Louisiana, and the
Woodford in Oklahoma have added hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of
natural gas to our recoverable resource base. Recent estimates of the Bakken
shale suggest that North Dakota could become second only to Texas as the
nation’s largest producer of crude. And thanks to the Canadian oil sands, the
EIA has recently estimated that our neighbors to the north posses a mammoth
178 billion barrels of oil reserves—second only to those of Saudi Arabia.

Methane Hydrates
Although not yet commercially feasible, methane hydrates, according to the
Department of Energy, possess energy content that is “immense…possibly
exceeding the combined energy content of all other known fossil fuels.”
While estimates vary significantly, the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) recently testified that: “the mean in-place gas hydrate resource for
the entire United States is estimated to be 320,000 TCF of gas.” For

perspective, if just 3 percent of this resource can be commercialized in the
years ahead, at current rates of consumption, that level of supply would be
enough to provide America’s natural gas for more than four hundred years.

Instead of continuing down the failed path of this job-killing global

warming green agenda, we could help bring affordable energy to consumers,
create new jobs, and grow the economy if the Obama Administration would
simply get out of the way so America can realize its true energy potential.340

CAP AND TRADE IS DEAD
Even with the final demise of the Kerry-Lieberman bill, it is important to
remember that the fight is not over: Moveon.org, the Hollywood elite and the
anti-sovereignty internationalists are still out there and working overtime to
implement their agenda. But as far as cap and trade as legislation is
concerned, Stuart Varney put it well in our May 12, 2010, interview when he
said, after I told him that Kerry-Lieberman didn’t stand a chance, “There you
have it: Last word on that: It’s dead.”

EPILOGUE

GETTING OUR COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK

ON JULY 1, 2011, one of the headlines in the Tulsa World read, “Inhofe
believes swimming in Grand Lake cause of his illness.”341 In fact, I was sure
of it: I saw green algae in Grand Lake earlier that week while I was
swimming and a few days later, when I was back in Washington, I became
deathly ill and had to fly back to Tulsa to recover. I joked about what the
headlines would be the next day: “The environment strikes back” or “Inhofe
attacked by the environment at last.”

The Sierra Club’s reaction was great: they sent me a rose and a get-well-
soon card with the message, “We hope you have a speedy recovery and that
we can work together to ensure all of our nation’s lakes are safe for
swimming, drinking and fishing.”342 I really appreciated their humor and
even brought the card to show everyone at our next Environment and Public
Works Committee hearing.

Reprinted with permission.

The jokes continued when I had to miss a big conference on climate
change sponsored by the Heartland Institute due to my algae illness. As
Stephen Stromberg of The Washington Post wrote in a piece called “A
Funny Thing Happened at the Climate Denier Conference.”

This is one of the most unintentionally hilarious turns of phrase I’ve seen
in a while. On Thursday, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) was supposed to
deliver the opening keynote address at the Heartland Institute’s sixth
International Conference on Climate Change, a conclave committed to
“abandoning the failed hypothesis of man-made climate change.” That is,
until he sent this statement to the conference’s organizers:

“I am sorry that I will not be able to join you today at the Heartland

Institute’s sixth International Conference on Climate Change.
Unfortunately, I am under the weather, but I did want to send a short note
to say thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.”

That must be some extreme weather.343

It was indeed extreme—I don’t think I’ve ever been so sick, but not too
sick not to address the conference from afar. I reminded them that the last
time this conference was held was just weeks after the House of
Representatives passed the Waxman-Markey global warming cap and trade
bill. With an overwhelming Democratic majority in the Senate, many
predicted that the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed into law
by President Obama in time for the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen.

But, we succeeded in defeating the bill by exposing the huge costs that

would be imposed on the American people for no environmental gain. I said
that Senate Democrats would not be able to go back to their constituents and
say aren’t you proud of me? I just voted for the largest tax increase in
American history. Further undermining their effort was the latest science
which showed that there was no “consensus” on global warming.

I had a similar message for the UN climate conference held in Cancun in
December 2010, which I delivered via a YouTube address from Washington.
I said, “The fact is, nothing is going to happen in Cancun this year and

everyone knows it. I couldn’t be happier and poor Al Gore couldn’t be more
upset: it has been widely reported that he is ‘depressed’ about Cancun.”344

CLIMATEGATE 2.0: CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE
IPCC CONTINUES
Of course, nothing happened at the UN global warming conference in
December 2011 in Durban, South Africa, either.

But true to form, just in time for the conference, the IPCC was at it again,

with the release of the Summary for Policymakers for its latest report on
extreme weather and global warming. But this time it faced an increasingly
skeptical public. In 2007, the IPCC’s so-called “smoking gun” report, which
claimed that there was an unequivocal link between humans and catastrophic
global warming, was all anyone ever talked about. On November 18, 2011,
when the discredited IPCC released its Summary for Policymakers, nobody
except me and Representative Markey even noticed.

If the IPCC wasn’t discredited enough, another batch of Climategate

emails, now known as Climategate 2.0, also surfaced on November 22, 2011,
just weeks before the UN climate conference in December. These emails
show more of the same manipulation of data and politicization of the science
by scientists contributing to the IPCC that was revealed in the original
Climategate scandal. One particular email with the title “inhofe & mann &
me” from journalist Andrew Revkin to Stefan Rahmstorf, a lead author of the
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, shows an interesting behind-the-scenes take
on how they felt about my message. As Rahmstorf writes, “Hi Andy, from
over here, it is hard to see this kind of Inhofe speach [sic] as anything else
than an irrelevant piece of absurd theatre. It doesn’t even bother me any more
—he’s simply lost it. Cheers, Stefan”

This email was written on September 26, 2006, and the speech to which

Rahmstorf is referring is my speech on the “Hot and Cold Media Spin Cycle”
which called out the media for using global warming hysteria to sell news,
and challenged them instead to take an objective approach to the science.

Revkin replies, “I know, but he still speaks to and for a big chunk of

America—people whose understanding of science and engagement with such
issues is so slight that they happily sit in pre-conceived positions.”

If Revkin is right about one thing in this email, it is that I speak to and for
a big chunk of America. Remember after I delivered that speech in 2006, my
Committee office was inundated with calls from Americans thanking me for
having the voice of reason amid all the hysteria. But my ability to reach a
wide audience is not due to Americans having only a “slight” understanding
of the science as Revkin alleges. It is due to the fact that American people
understand all too well the politicization of the science, the manipulation of
the data, and the “tricks” implemented by many IPCC scientists to come to
preconceived solutions.

The IPCC can only blame itself for its irrelevance today and everyone
knows it, including many in the liberal media. As Joe Romm of Climate
Progress said about these emails being released just before the UN climate
conference in Durban, “It’s so refreshing that anybody thinks those climate
talks actually matter.”345

WHAT WILL THEY TRY NEXT?
Of course, Al Gore and Big Green may be down at the moment but they are
not out. These global warming alarmists have not given up their efforts to
continue to push their agenda. At the climate conferences in Cancun and
Durban, some leaders were stepping up their attacks on capitalism and
United Nations officials were saying they need to do more to “spread the
wealth around.”

It was just more of the same, only now they no longer have global

warming hysteria to back it up. So what will they do next to try to implement
their green regime?

Looking back, it is crystal clear that this debate was never about saving

the world from man-made global warming; it was always about how we live
our lives. It was about whether we wanted the United Nations to “level the
playing field worldwide” and “redistribute the wealth.” It was about
government deciding what forms of energy we could use.

From the alarmism to their so-called solutions, the issue has always pitted

big government supporters against strong individualism. That mindset has
always led me to believe that the liberal agenda pushing the global warming
movement will never win. But that doesn’t mean they won’t keep on trying.

The first big question they will be forced to answer: will they keep Al

Gore, Rajendra Pachauri, and James Hansen as the three faces of the
movement? While the trio did wonders in catching the media’s attention
during the glory years of alarmism, each has faced their own troubles ever
since. Al Gore’s problems are obvious, but there have also been calls for
Pachauri to resign as head of the IPCC. Hansen also faces questions from his
own side because of his environmental activism and his inconvenient
campaign against cap and trade.346

The other big question they will be forced to answer is: will they stay on
track with their green energy future talking points or go back to try and scare
the American people through alarmism again?

They tried alarmism in October 2010, and it failed miserably. A group

called 10:10 released a film, No Pressure, that featured children who don’t
believe in global warming being blown up by their teacher. The group said
that it was meant to be funny, but it created so much outrage with the public
that the video had to be immediately pulled down from the organization’s
Web site. It was the most outrageous, last-ditch effort to scare little kids into
thinking that they could be killed if they don’t believe what they’re told to
believe.

And it was no amateur production team. As the UK Guardian reported,
the film featured “film star Gillian Anderson and England footballer Peter
Crouch, with music donated by Radiohead and shot by a forty-strong
professional film crew led by director Dougal Wilson, it was intended to
galvanise viewers into taking personal action to reduce their own carbon
footprint.”347

The Guardian also writes this line from one of the child actors: “Jamie
Glover, the child-actor who plays the part of Philip and gets blown up, has
similarly few qualms: ‘I was very happy to get blown up to save the
world.’”348

Then in October 2011, the media had the chance they had been waiting for
to promote alarmism again. Richard Muller, a professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, released a report from the Berkeley Earth Surface
Temperatures project team (BEST) that claimed that the world was warming
at an alarming rate—conveniently just in time for the 2011 UN climate
change conference in Durban, South Africa.349 In an op-ed the Wall Street

Journal Muller boldly declared that the age of skepticism was over and that
“you should not be a skeptic, at least not any longer.”350

The media, which had gone through a prolonged cooling spell on global
warming, jumped on the story immediately. AP reporter Seth Borenstein, the
same reporter who wrote the glowing article, “Scientists give two thumbs up
to Gore’s movie” in 2006, wrote an article on Muller’s report called
“Skeptic finds he now agrees global warming is real.”351 Of course, in
typical fashion, a fawning media storm ensued. David Rose wrote in an
October 30, 2011, Mail Online article called, “Scientist who said climate
change sceptics had been proved wrong accused of hiding truth by
colleague” about the media mania that was drummed up, explained that “It
was cited uncritically by, among others, reporters and commentators from the
BBC, the Independent, the Guardian, the Economist, and numerous media
outlets in America. The Washington Post said the BEST study had ‘settled
the climate change debate’ and showed that anyone who remained a skeptic
was committing a ‘cynical fraud.’”352

This indulgence in alarmism, however, was so short lived it was over

before many even realized it started. Upon further review, it turned out that
Muller’s study did not evaluate if the warming was man-made and it also
was not properly peer reviewed. In fact, Muller released his findings without
even informing his colleagues in the study, Professor Judith Curry and
Anthony Watts. As Professor Curry said, “Of course this isn’t the end of
skepticism. To say that is the biggest mistake he [Prof Muller] has made.”353

By the way, Muller is far from being a former skeptic. In fact, we
specifically excluded him from our Senate report on skeptic scientists
because he was clearly on the other side of the debate. We haven’t heard
about Richard Muller since.

We also haven’t heard much about green jobs lately.
With the total collapse of Solyndra and dismal unemployment numbers,

their “clean energy future” and “clean energy jobs” talking points have
clearly failed as well so it will be interesting to see what they try next.

2012 ELECTIONS: STOPPING OBAMA’S WAR ON
AFFORDABLE ENERGY

Today the mood in Washington is significantly different. Everyone readily
admits that cap and trade legislation is dead on Capitol Hill—even our good
friend, Senator Boxer.354

Now as the 2012 elections approach Presidential candidates are dropping
global warming like a hot potato. Presidential candidate and former Speaker
of the House Newt Gingrich told Fox News on November 8, 2011, that
holding hands with Nancy Pelosi on the sofa saying we must do something
about global warming in an ad sponsored by Al Gore’s climate alliance is
“probably the dumbest single thing I’ve done in recent years.”355

I couldn’t agree more, and I appreciate his honesty.
With the hysteria about catastrophic man-made global warming behind us,

our fight against the hoax has shifted to stopping President Obama from
imposing through regulation what he was unable to achieve through
legislation.

With nineteen House Democrats supporting the Upton-Inhofe Energy Tax

Prevention Act, and sixty-four senators on the record in some way against
EPA, all eyes are on EPA and the White House. Will EPA change course?
Will President Obama accept that his cap and trade agenda is wildly
unpopular, and agree to drop it? Don’t hold your breath.

Now in the wake of the EPA Inspector General report which reveals that

EPA did not engage in the proper record-keeping process or follow the
required peer review procedures leading up to the endangerment finding—on
top of the fact that the science comes from the IPCC, whose credibility is
seriously called into question—the very foundation of the endangerment
finding is quickly crumbling, and I think it will only be a matter of time
before it collapses.356

In the meantime, the debate continues, and the battle over the Energy Tax
Prevention Act and Obama’s war on affordable energy carries on. The bill
will come to the floor again, and soon, so members will once again have to
decide whether they stand with consumers, manufacturers, farmers, and small
businesses, or with EPA’s barrage of greenhouse gas regulations that will
harm all of them.

My hope is that if the endangerment finding does not collapse under the
weight of its own flaws, which I believe it will, the Energy Tax Prevention
Act will have a clear path towards victory after the 2012 elections.

MOVING ON FROM THE HOAX
What I said on the Senate floor in July 2003 is exactly the same message I
have had ever since. The science behind man-made catastrophic global
warming simply isn’t there and the United States Senate would never ratify
Kyoto or pass cap and trade. I am vindicated on these points today and now
that the global warming hysteria is behind us, its time to get back to powering
this amazing machine called America, which is the surest way to revive our
ailing economy. The United States has a clear choice: we can continue
implementing Al Gore and President Obama’s global warming agenda, which
is destroying jobs and doing great harm to our economy, or we can elect
officials who support developing our nation’s vast natural resources, which
are the key to our nation’s recovery. With the November 2012 elections on
the horizon, we finally have the chance to stop Obama’s cap and trade agenda
and its mindless restrictions on our ability to develop and produce our own
resources.

But the demise of the Obama Administration does not mean that they

won’t keep trying. They’ll be back: MoveOn.org, the Hollywood elite, the
anti-sovereignty internationalists are still out there and they still have the
resources to be dangerous.

However, I firmly believe that when the history of our era is written,

future generations will look back and wonder why we spent so much time
and effort on global warming and pointless “solutions” like Kyoto and cap
and trade. In the end, through all the hysteria, all the fear, and all the phony
science, what global warming alarmists have often forgotten is that God is
still up there, and as Genesis 8:22 reminds us:

“As long as the earth remains,

there will be springtime and harvest,

cold and heat, winter and summer,

day and night.”357

AFTERWORD

WHAT GLOBAL WARMING AND EARMARKS

HAVE IN COMMON

OR THIS COULD BE ENTITLED, “President Obama’s greatest victory…a gift
from Republicans.”

This will be the most difficult concept for conservatives to comprehend,

let alone embrace. As I watched this “gift” unfold, this ceding of our
Constitutional authority to President Obama, I felt perhaps the greatest
frustration of all in my over ten-year battle against the hoax. How would the
Obama bureaucracy be emboldened with their enhanced authority? How
could they use it to advance their effort to pass the greatest tax increase in
history, cap and trade? As difficult as it is, I will ask you to read on.
Difficult? Yes, because it contradicts a basic tenant that most conservatives
have been led to believe. However, there is a happy ending.

THE LONE VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS
On November 22, 2010, Roll Call published an article entitled, “Inhofe
Happy to Stand Apart” which laid out the reasons why I am often alone
opposing some key “politically correct” issues—most recently the
moratorium on earmarks:

In an interview last week, [Inhofe] recalled a time when one of his
grandchildren “came up to me and said, ‘Pop-I, Why do you always do
things that nobody else does?’ … and I said, ‘because nobody else
does.’”

Case in point: As many of his GOP colleagues reversed long-held
positions on an earmark ban last week, Inhofe proudly defended his
support of the practice.

Republicans adopted an internal rules change to create a voluntary ban
on requesting any kind of earmark—including transportation projects, tax
cuts for particular industry sectors or other Congressionally directed
funding.358

Of course, I would so much rather join the crowd and hold hands and have

a ban on earmarks and everybody’s happy. But I do what nobody else does
because I’ve got twenty kids and grandkids. The things we’re doing today are
not for me, they’re for the future. In the 1970s, I was the “lone voice in the
wilderness” in Oklahoma pushing for the balanced budget amendment; I
risked expulsion in the House of Representatives to overturn the discharge
petition that was allowing members to hide their votes from the public; for
many years, I was the only one willing to take the most politically incorrect
position at the time and challenge the science behind the global warming
hoax; and now I am one of the few senators standing up against the earmark
moratorium in Congress. But, as before, I will eventually be proven right.

Before I go any further, let me redeem myself with my conservative

readers. The American Conservative Union has ranked me the number one
most conservative member in the United States Senate. Human Events, in
editorializing on the “Top 10 Most Outstanding Conservative Senators,”
ranked me number one, calling me an “unabashed conservative; he’s unafraid
to speak his mind.” I was also recognized by The National Journal as the
number one conservative in the United States Senate for 2009.

While I am often the lone voice in the wilderness, I am glad that my good

friend Paul Weyrich, co-founder of the Heritage Foundation and a leading
conservative, agreed with me in a column for Renew America called
“Senator Inhofe: Transportation, Work, and Achievement,” which was
published September 12, 2006. This piece is very important to me because it
was one of the last things Weyrich wrote before his death. As Weyrich rightly
said, “[Inhofe] and I always tell our fellow conservatives that the two
matters as to which the Federal Government is authorized to spend money are
defense and infrastructure.” He called me a work horse not a show horse
because of my efforts on bills that receive less attention, such as the Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA)—an important bill that funds water
infrastructure projects. Of course, Weyrich put it best so I’ll let him speak to
that:

Senator Inhofe: Transportation, Work, and Achievement
By Paul Weyrich
September 12, 2006

When I came to work in the United States Senate, 40 years ago this
January, I quickly learned that there are two kinds of Senators—
workhorses and show horses. I dare say few, if any, high school students
could name all 100. Indeed most teachers would be impressed if their
high-schoolers could name the two Senators from their own State.

I have watched over the years the Senators who never met a

microphone they didn’t try to get in front of. Then I have watched the
Senators who work quietly on matters vital to the nation but who get very
little coverage for doing so.

One of the workhorse Senators is James M. Inhofe (R-OK). His is

hardly a household name outside his own state, where he wins by
landslide margins. In the Senate he doggedly works on various pieces of
non-sexy legislation. Often his work pertains to national defense. I have
seen him go toe to toe with both the Clinton and Bush Administrations.
And he won. I have seen him clash with the Congressional leadership of
his own party. For example, he got the rules changed so that Congressmen
who sign a discharge petition (to force a bill to the floor against the
wishes of the leadership) must do so in broad daylight. The rules
previously permitted them to hide behind procedure.

Having been trained by two workhorse Senators I appreciate them a

lot more than those who will say anything to get on television. The reason
I mention Jim Inhofe is because of the 100 Senators I would put him as
the top workhorse Senator. He works on many projects at once. He
pursues them until they are complete. Do not get me wrong, he is good on
television. Since the advent of the Fox News Channel, he now has begun
to get some exposure and he does well. Primarily, however, he does what
he is now doing—that is, working on an infrastructure bill that has almost
no national following. He is shepherding something called the Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA). He and I always tell our fellow
conservatives that the two matters as to which the Federal Government is
authorized to spend money are defense and infrastructure. Two summers

ago Inhofe secured passage of the Transportation Bill, which took
incredible skill on his part. Yes, it has a few questionable items but by
and large that bill was an extraordinary piece of work. I praised him for
it at the time and I do so again today, despite all the criticism. We both
believe that spending outside of defense and infrastructure is stretching
the Constitution to a point beyond recognition.

Anyway, back to this legislation, the bill Inhofe is now working on
authorizes the Corp of Engineers to do flood control, navigation and
environmental restoration projects. For example, the average
transportation cost savings of users of the inland waterway system is
$10.76 per ton hauled or $7 billion annually over rail, highways and air
transportation.

Flood control, as demonstrated during Katrina and Rita, is a critical

service provided by the Army Corps of Engineers. Money was
appropriated to fix those infamous levies in New Orleans but local
politicians always diverted the money to their own projects and now we
are all paying the price. Nevertheless, according to the American Society
of Civil Engineers, flood control structures on average prevent $22
billion in flood damage per year. That is a saving of $6 for every $1
spent.

Clearly, projects that promote economic growth through good

movements or prevent damage due to flooding are not pork. Yet many in
the media, who never understand the big picture in this country, pick on
some project in a Congressman’s district and charge him with bringing
home the pork. Not always so. Recognizing that not all proposed flood
control or navigation projects are necessary, the Senate has established
firm criteria for evaluating project requests.

First, projects have to have a chief report, which means that the Corps

of Engineers has determined that the project is technically feasible,
environmentally sound and economically justified. Second, Inhofe and his
committee attempt to oppose any environmental infrastructure project
which is outside the scope of the main mission. You can imagine that
there are Senators on Inhofe’s committee who do bring pork to the table.
Inhofe won’t budge on that point. Finally, Inhofe’s Environment and

Public Works Committee opposes cost waivers, thus following the policy
established in the WRDA Bill of 1986 which established cost-sharing
requirements. In order for a project to be built local communities must be
willing to pay some cost of the project. The same is true in the
Transportation Bill only in that measure there is a huge disparity between
highways and transit. With highways the Federal Government pays 80 to
90% of the project. With transit, say a light rail line in Denver, the
Federal Government will only pay on average around 50%.

Just as in the Transportation Bill (known around here as SAFETEA-

LU), in which the Senator got his Committee to agree that projects
eligible for Highway Trust Fund dollars be on the State’s transportation,
the Senate WRDA Bill established and stayed with strict criteria for
WRDA projects in an attempt to avoid funding any project which is not
justified.

Work on this measure has been long and hard. Inhofe wants to get the

final bill passed in these waning days of the 109th Congress. But for
Senators like Inhofe (and there are not many—eight or nine at best) who
are willing to do the non-exciting, non-sexy work, the real business of the
Senate would not go on. The WRDA Bill is important and we can be
thankful that Inhofe is behind it, inching it along to enactment.359

I am not including the Weyrich op-ed a as self ingratiating gesture but to
set up the concept that bureaucratic earmarks, as opposed to congressional
earmarks, played a significant role in promoting the whole hoax, using the
bureaucracy as a brainwashing mechanism. Read on, you’ll see.

LEGISLATORS VS. BUREAUCRATS
There is a very important difference between legislators and bureaucrats.
Legislators are elected officials—at the federal level, Congresspersons
serving in the United States House of Representatives, and Senators serving
in the United States Senate. Legislators pass laws that are signed into effect
by the president as the chief administrator of the government. Legislators are
periodically re-elected, or un-elected, by their constituencies. They are
accountable to the people.

In very sharp contrast, agency bureaucrats are appointed officials—they
are part of the executive branch of government, ultimately approved by the
President. They are not elected. They are not accountable to the people. They
serve and are accountable to the president.

The key question for every citizen is: Who do you want making decisions
about your life? Someone who is elected that you can vote out of office, or an
unelected, unaccountable bureaucrat?

A POWER GRAB BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
Through an overwhelming number of regulations, we are experiencing a
masterful power grab on the part of the Executive Branch—in other words,
the president.

This is especially obvious in the efforts by the Obama administration to
take over regulation of a number of sectors of our society such as healthcare
and banking. More recently, the power grab has extended to control of
energy, power, global warming, and climate change. Obama’s power-grab
through the EPA is as massive as that of the Obama healthcare bill.

When I was privileged to testify before a House of Representatives

Subcommittee on Energy and Power in February 9, 2011, concerning the
“Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011.” I explained the goal of the bill is to
keep the EPA from imposing climate-change regulations.

The legislation is designed to reassert the authority of Congress rather
than to allow unelected bureaucrats to decide regulations on all forms of
energy and to specifically hold the EPA accountable.

Of course, Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) said that our bill

should be called the “Big Polluter Protection Act.”360 He went on to say that
our bill would “repeal the only authority the administration has to protect our
health and the environment without providing any alternative.”361 However,
Congressman Waxman should know there is no “alternative” even necessary
because there is no need for the administration to take such economically
severe measures to protect our health and environment. There is no threat to
our health and environment.

What happened to push Congressman Upton and me to action? Since the
normal legislative process has failed the Obama Administration due to lack
of support from the Congress and the American people, they are pursuing

regulations to enact what would amount to a cap-and-tax law. The good news
at this point is that the House of Representatives is eager to pass such a
change in EPA powers. The Senate isn’t quite there yet. I’m eager for that day
to come.

THE EPA CLAIMS AND MY REBUTTAL
The EPA claims that it has both justification and Supreme Court authority to
regulate CO2 as a pollutant and to impose regulations that will end up
seriously impacting virtually every aspect of American business and daily
life.

My leading contention before the subcommittee was that the Clean Air Act

—a bill designed to deal with air quality—was passed by Congress with a
deliberate intent not to regulate so-called greenhouse gases. The Clean Air
Act had nothing to do with climate change. Its primary directives were
related initially to the regulation of what were called “criteria pollutants”
such as ozone, particulate matter, and lead.

Furthermore, the Waxman-Markey bill that the House passed did have to

do with greenhouse gases. That bill died with Senate inaction and the
election of a new Congress. Greenhouse gasses were an issue in the 2010
election that saw control of the House move to the Republicans. I have no
doubt that a bill such as Waxman-Markey would not pass the House today.

In her testimony before the subcommittee, EPA Administrator Lisa

Jackson referenced the 5–4 decision by the Supreme Court, Massachusetts v.
EPA,362 testifying that the Supreme Court concluded that the Clean Air Act’s
definition of air pollutants includes greenhouse gases.363

What the Supreme Court said was this: the EPA has the discretion to
decide whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.
However, Administrator Jackson proceeded in making the endangerment
finding that greenhouse gases are a threat to human health, and welfare.

THE GREATER TREND TOWARD PRESIDENTIAL RULE
The issues involving the EPA are symptomatic of a much broader escalating
trend toward greater and greater Presidential authority through bureaucratic
agencies. This trend continues to a great extent, I believe, because people use
terminology that hides the process.

In a word…earmarks. I consider it one of the most misunderstood words

in our American language today.

WHAT REALLY IS AN EARMARK?
If you ask people today what’s wrong with the federal government, they may
say runaway deficits or wasteful spending, and I agree with that. However,
they may also say earmarks, and I believe they do that because very few
people really understand just what an earmark is. In order to understand
earmarks, you must know the difference between Congressional
authorizations and Congressional appropriations, and you must further
understand the difference between Congressional earmarks and Obama
Administration earmarks. Yes, there are two types of earmarks.

Congress passes laws that authorize specific programs and either

authorizes the overall dollar amount for the program or simply states “such
sums as may be necessary.” An example of an authorization act is the Energy
Independence and Security Act in 2007.364

After a law has been passed, Congress then appropriates funds to carry
out programs contained in the law, across all of the federal departments and
agencies. During the appropriations process, Congress may designate,
through an earmark, that a certain amount of the funds available must be spent
on a particular program or issue. For example, they may specify that under
the Highway program, $100,000 must be used to help a small community
deal with a deteriorating highway. This $100,000 is taken out of the larger
pool of money that Congress authorizes for the program. These earmarks or
appropriations are not additional funds added to the federal budget.

Here’s the crux of the issue: The vast majority of funds are not earmarked
by Congress. Executive-branch officials decide how to spend the funds in the
vast majority of all programs. The Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007 provides for greenhouse gas and climate research in a variety of
sections of the law. The money is spent by either political appointees in the
Executive Branch, or in most cases, by career bureaucrats in each of the
agencies and departments. But in the final analysis, it’s Obama.

One starts to see the connection between global warming and climate

research and earmarks. During the decade-long battle against cap and trade
and other climate legislation, I was not only fighting the global-warming
enthusiasts but also the process that was allowing billions of dollars that

were given to unelected bureaucrats to dish out as they desired. Keep the
concept very clear: unelected bureaucrats are given supervisory control over
bureaucratic-agency earmarks.

You might ask why Executive branch or bureaucratic earmarks are any

worse than Congressional earmarks. The answer is that in bureaucratic
earmarks, most of the decisions are made by the career bureaucrats who are
unaccountable to the people.

The people elect their 535 Congressional representatives, the House and

the Senate, who have a much better idea of how the people want their tax
dollars spent. On the other hand, they elect one president, who is responsible
for the entire Executive branch. The Congressional Research Service reports
that the president, in turn, appoints approximately one thousand cabinet and
subcabinet officials who are confirmed by the Senate,365 with additional
hundreds of political appointees. In all, these bureaucrats run government
agencies—fielding requests for grants and other types of funding, submitting
those requests to the president for his budget and then, when Congress fails to
do its part, receiving jurisdiction over that money to pass it on to those of
their choosing.

While having a thousand Senate confirmed “managers” and a few

thousand related staffers might seem like enough, you must also keep in mind
that these employees of the federal government oversee hundreds of
thousands of federal employees who make decisions every day from
Washington, D.C., about how your federal tax dollars are spent.

Are you aware that most federal employees serve regardless who is

elected president? Just under the political appointees are a group of
managers called the Senior Executive Service. These Senior Executives, in
turn, oversee at least thousands of additional managers, all of whom have
authority to spend federal dollars. Our federal workforce is growing at an
alarming rate; the Obama Administration has reportedly added more than
200,000 new positions.366 The exact number may be disputable. What is not
disputable is that these unelected bureaucrats, who do not answer to the
public or the voters, make decisions every day on how to spend your tax
dollars.

Even if every member of Congress and all one thousand of the president’s
political appointees try to guard against wasteful spending, they are grossly
outnumbered by the career bureaucratic managers and staff.

How does this impact climate change? Quite simply, the career

bureaucrats at the EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and numerous other
departments and agencies have been earmarking climate science money to
their pet researchers for decades; regardless of the will of Congress or who
the president might be. It may shock you to know which presidential
administration spent more on climate research. It wasn’t Bill Clinton. The
Administration of George W. Bush spent more than three times more money
on climate research than the Clinton Administration. Who decided how to
spend the money? It wasn’t President Bush or Vice President Cheney.

Career bureaucrats across the federal government spent hundreds of

millions of dollars during the Bush Administration funding the work of Dr.
Mann and his cohorts, and it wasn’t through Congressional earmarks. A
Congressional earmark to fund Dr. Mann would have never passed Congress,
not as long as I was in the U.S. Senate.

WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
In March 2010, talk show host and political pundit Sean Hannity had a series
about what he considered to be the 102 worst “earmarks” related to

After Hannity’s program aired, I repeated his list in a speech I gave on the

Senate Floor. I asked, “What do all of these 102 ‘earmarks’ have in
common? Answer: Not one is a Congressional earmark. They were all
enacted by President Obama and his bureaucrats.”368

I could not agree more that these are examples of unnecessary, silly,

wasteful spending. That $4.9 BILLION could certainly have been spent more
wisely… or not at all!

But not one of these expenditures was authorized by the Senate. They

were expenditures authorized, and spent, by President Obama and his
bureaucrats because the Senate did not do its constitutional duty. They were
bureaucratic earmarks!

Why do I place the burden of blame on the Senate for these expenditures?

Because the House Republicans had invoked a one-year moratorium on
“earmarks,” defining “earmarks” in the House rules, which I will explain
later. The House Republicans not only initiated a “year-long ban” on
earmarks, but encouraged both the House Democrats and the Senate to do the
same. This Republican decision in the House came a day after House
Democrats said they wouldn’t fund special projects for defense contractors,
energy firms, or private companies in general.

Democrat Congressman David Obey said, “The political reality right now

is that the public has lost some confidence in this institution and one of the
reasons is the past abuse of the earmark process.”369

My reaction to Congressman Obey was that the earmark process is not

what has caused the public to lose confidence. The public has lost
confidence in the legislative branch when it comes to spending issues
because we have created deficits in discretionary spending and we have

failed to tackle the GIANTS of spending—the entitlement programs that
continue to grow without restraint.

The Democrat Senator Daniel Inouye, Chair of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, agreed to a two-year moratorium on earmarks, explaining, “The
handwriting is clearly on the wall,” Inouye said in a statement. “The
president has stated unequivocally that he will veto any legislation containing
earmarks.”370 Of course he would. He and his bureaucrats can still spend it.
Big win for President Obama.

So there we have it. Democrats and Republicans alike in the House of
Representatives and in the Senate jumped on a phony “abolish earmarks”
bandwagon. So let’s examine what they, the House Democrats and
Republicans, are saying.

Those who advocate the end of Congressional earmarks are saying, in

effect, “Let’s give all authority for the function of government programs to a
centralized executive branch.”

While there is spending that should be refused appropriation or

authorization, an across-the-board ban is wrong. Items should be defeated by
Congress on the basis of their substance, not as part of a sweeping ban on all
appropriations and authorizations. Let me give you examples. Improved
armor for our soldiers with MRAP vehicles (Mine Resistant and Ambush
Protected) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, such as the Predator drone, are
examples of Congressional appropriations that have improved our national
defense. In these cases, appropriations that some erroneously call
“earmarks,” saved lives.371

Banning or eliminating Congressional appropriations they call earmarks,
simply sends the money to the Executive Branch. The expenditure of taxpayer
dollars remains at the same level, only with bureaucrats and administration
officials allocating the funds rather than Congress. Not one dime is saved.
The Democrats are more than happy to see Republicans abandon their

authorization and appropriation responsibilities. It allows the current
Democrat-run executive branch to spend, spend, spend.

I was appalled at what the House Republicans chose to do. It was flat-out

wrong on several accounts. First, the resolution they passed was this:
“Resolve, that it is the policy of the Republican Conference that no Member
shall request a congressional earmark… as such terms are used in Clause 9
of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House for the 111th Congress.” Clause 9 of

Rule XXI applies to all legislation in the House of Representatives, whether
it be authorization, appropriation, tax, or tariff legislation.372

THE REVERSAL OF A SOLEMN OATH
It was clear to me that these elected officials abrogated their responsibility,
and their actions resulted in a large expenditure of money that they could
have stopped. I see a real dereliction of duty.

Every House Republican who voted for the resolution was a Member of

Congress who had taken an oath and solemnly swore, “I will support and
bear true allegiance to the Constitution of the United States… so help me
God.” In the wake of this Republican resolution in the House, some sought to
make a case that the Republicans had just trashed their oath of office and the
Constitution. And they were right. But, as I mentioned previously, the House
Democrats jumped on the bandwagon and were equally guilty.

THE VALUE OF DEBATE ABOUT SPENDING
One of the main benefits of spending in the hands of legislators is that
national programs can be better tailored to fit regional needs. It is the rightful
role of Congress to participate in directing federal funds to the areas where
the funds are most beneficial.

In 2008, Congress was faced with the task of appropriating and

authorizing the spending of funds intended to pay for transportation programs,
including congestion mitigation. That year, Congress distributed the millions
of dollars in the program’s funding through Congressional earmarks for one
hundred projects in thirty-five states. The year before, when no
Congressional earmarks were permitted, the Transportation Department (of
the Executive Branch of government) funded projects through bureaucratic
earmarks through grant competition. It didn’t appear that much competition
occurred. All of these bureaucratic earmarks went to only five big cities—
Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle.
All of these cities, by the way, were considered to be Democrat strongholds.
And that was during the Bush Administration! It doesn’t really matter who
sits in the White House. If Congress doesn’t do its job, the Executive-Branch
bureaucrats who hold jobs for a lifetime are able to wield a great deal of

economic power. Their political bias cannot be challenged or stopped,
unless Congress steps in before they have a chance to distribute funds.

A DIVERSION FROM THE BIGGER ISSUE
The real issue is the bloated government budget, mostly in the area of
entitlements and other large programs. Rather than take on those spending
behemoths, the media and others are turning attention on smaller amounts that
are disturbing, but certainly miniscule in size compared to the sink holes of
entitlement programs. And not just entitlements. How about the $700 billion
TARP, nearly $890 billion stimulus, and the $2.5 trillion Obamacare? I’m
embarrassed to admit that TARP was the Republicans’ fault as much as the
Democrats. On October 1, 2008, seventy-four senators including thirty-four
Republicans gave an unelected bureaucrat $700 billion with no
accountability. I call it Group Therapy. People will forget, and they did.
What did they do with the TARP money? Bailouts: AIG, Chrysler, GM, and
the rest of them. And the very Republicans who voted for the $700 billion
TARP spent hours on the Senate Floor complaining about the bailouts that
TARP funded. And sure enough, everyone forgot. But they didn’t forget about
“earmarks.” That diversionary tactic worked beautifully.

In only 2009 and 2010, of the $3.1 trillion and $3.6 trillion budgets,
Congressional earmarks make up less than half a percent. However, they
seem to get 100 percent of the attention.

RAUCH GOT IT RIGHT!
Jonathan Rauch wrote an article titled “Earmarks Are a Model, Not a
Menace” that appeared in the National Journal (March 14, 2009). Here are
my favorite excerpts from that article:

Beating up on earmarks is fun. But if you interrupt the joy long enough to
take a closer look, you may discover that the case against earmarks has
pretty much evaporated over the past few years. In fact, reformers seem
to want to hound out of existence a system that actually works better than
much of what Washington does…

As transparency has taken over, the case against earmarks has melted
away. Their budgetary impact is trivial in comparison with entitlements

and other large programs. Obsessing about earmarks, indeed, has the
perverse, if convenient, effect of distracting the country from its real
spending problems, thus substituting indignation for discipline….

Some earmark spending is silly, but then so is some non-earmark

spending, and there is a lot more of the latter….

And earmark spending today is, if anything, more transparent, more

accountable, and more promptly disclosed than is non-earmark spending.
Indeed, executive agencies could stand to emulate some of the online
disclosure rules that apply to earmarks.373
I pretty well covered the argument succinctly in an op-ed piece I did for

the Washington Times on December 3, 2010. I wrote:

I am used to being all alone. I was the only “no” vote in the Senate on the
Everglades Restoration Act. Three years later, major publications said I
was right and the other 99 were wrong. In 2002, I was alone in exposing
the global-warming hysteria as a hoax. Now I have been vindicated on
that issue as well. As the only conservative Republican to vote against
the earmark moratorium within our conference, I find myself alone once
again. But, as before, I eventually will be proved right. My opposition to
the moratorium is based on my concern that Congress would be ceding its
constitutional authority to the president, while failing to save a single
taxpayer dime and distracting from the real issue of out-of-control deficit
spending.

A politically correct ban on congressional earmarks will give

President Obama even greater power and authority in the expenditure of
taxpayer funds. In other words, in the case of Mr. Obama, he would have
more money to pursue his liberal agenda. No wonder he was so quick to
endorse a ban on congressional earmarks.

With this greater power, the Obama administration will embark on its

own bureaucratic earmarks, which will result in the same type of
spending that we saw from the stimulus bill, which did not contain a
single congressionally directed spending item. These types of
presidential earmarks will mean spending millions of tax dollars for

turtle walkways, toilets in national parks, research on the mating habits of
insects, and equipment to find radioactive rabbit droppings. Lobbyists
already have been hitting up federal agencies at increased rates. A ban on
congressional earmarks will only further increase the number of lobbyists
seeking influence with the executive branch.

Congress would then be nothing more than a rubber stamp for Mr.

Obama’s spending requests. Transparency, accountability and the
public’s recourse would greatly diminish. Currently, members of
Congress must make public notice of their spending requests in advance,
then be held accountable by voters. However, a ban on congressional
earmarks would result in the public being kept in the dark until a year or
more after a presidential earmark already has been spent. At the same
time, voters would be powerless to hold faceless bureaucrats
accountable. What’s worse is that the whole process would be pushed
into Washington’s darkest corners, outside the public’s purview.

That is not how our Founding Fathers envisioned our government. That

is why, when writing the U.S. Constitution, they gave Congress, not the
executive branch, the power of the purse. Writing in the Federalist
Papers, James Madison noted that Congress holds this power for the very
reason that it is closer to the people. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story
noted in 1833 that if this authority were given to the president, “the
executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of
the nation; and might apply all its monied resources at his pleasure. The
power to control, and direct the appropriations, constitutes a most useful
and salutary check upon profusion and extravagance, as well as upon
corrupt influence and public peculation.” Congress should not cede this
authority to the executive branch.

Minus real reforms from Congress to reduce spending, federal

spending will continue to spiral out of control. Why? Because banning
congressional earmarks won’t save a single taxpayer dime. If an
appropriations item that is directed by Congress is removed (or an
attempt is made to remove the item), the money does not return to the
Treasury to pay down the debt. Instead, the bottom-line expenditure
amount remains the same, and the money is put into the hands of the

executive branch, in this case, Mr. Obama, to spend how it sees fit. Given
that the overall number and dollar amount of earmarks has decreased
steadily over the past several years while the federal debt has increased
by $3 trillion in just two years, an earmark ban is not the answer to our
fiscal problems.

Eliminating all earmarks would have additional consequences. Vitally

important earmarks, such as to provide improved armor that has saved
lives for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Predator drone
program, which has been vital in the war on terrorism, would not be
possible if the ban were in place. Both are examples of congressional
earmarks that never would have been funded by the administration.

Let me explain it a different way. This is how it is supposed to work. The
President submits his budget to Congress. The authorization committee then
evaluates that budget and makes changes within the President’s bottom line.
In other words, the authorization committee recommends to Congress the
areas where we can best provide funding for items in the President’s budget.
Let’s take an example: I serve on the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee
which is an authorization committee staffed with defense experts from strike
vehicles to missile defense. Before the ban on congressional earmarks, the
President’s budget contained $350.6 million for a launching system referred
to as a “box of rockets” (otherwise known as the Non Line of Sight—
Launching System). The Senate Armed Services Committee agreed that the
launching system was good but we had a greater need for strike vehicles. So
we struck the launching system and used the money to buy six new F18 E and
F aircrafts. It didn’t cost any more, it just redirected the money to something
that would enhance our defense system in a greater way.374

But wait. These kinds of changes can be characterized as earmarks.
However, without these kinds of changes, the President would make all
spending decisions. This is not what Article 1 Section 9 of the Constitution
says. The legislative branch is supposed to do the authorizing and
appropriating. To be clear, many things that are proposed to be authorized
and appropriated should be defeated. But we should defeat them based on the
substance, not simply because they are called earmarks. I continued in my
op-ed:

Unfortunately, the years of demagoguing earmarks have distracted the
American people from the real fiscal problems that face our nation. We
must do something to stop runaway spending. Ironically, the authors of the
ban both supported the $700 billion bailout and the $50 billion
President’s Plan for Emergency AIDS Relief bill, two of the largest
measures of 2008. That same year, the Office of Management and Budget
calculated total earmark spending at $15 billion. So, by supporting just
those two measures, they obligated the government to 50 times the total of
all earmarks for that year.

There is a simple solution to the earmark problem that I have been

advocating for more than five years. All we have to do is redefine
“earmark” as spending that has not been authorized, meaning it has not
been approved by the committee of jurisdiction. Then eliminate all
earmarks—no exceptions. That’s all. Problem solved. Then we can go
after the real problems, the big stuff like the debt and the deficit.

Let me repeat. The only reason I bring up the earmark issue is to

demonstrate that my decade-long fight against global warming has ALSO
been a simultaneous fight against bureaucratic earmarks, and the unwise
spending of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.375

I applaud Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) in being one of the only

conservative Republicans in the House to defy the demagoguery and join me.
Congressman Paul and I recently issued a joint new release titled “Earmark
Ban a Huge Victory for Obama” in which we said the following:

The current ban on congressional earmarks gives the Obama
administration and federal bureaucrats even greater power and authority
over the expenditure of taxpayer funds. It’s no surprise, then, that Mr.
Obama was quick to endorse the ban on congressional earmarks—it
grants his administration more power to pursue its agenda by exercising a
power that properly resides with Congress. The president even endorsed
the ban with his veto threat during this year’s State of the Union Address
and in subsequent speeches.

With this greater power, the Obama administration (and future

administrations) will embark on its own bureaucratic earmarks through a

process that will mean less transparency and little accountability for the
American people. The infamous $787 billion Stimulus bill, which both of us
vigorously opposed and voted against, did not contain a single Congressional
earmark. Instead, millions in bureaucratic earmarks were spent for programs
to determine the affects of intoxication on mice, the protection of insects from
other insects, the mating habits of bugs and rodents, and walkways for turtles.

We were the only two conservatives to be outspoken against the

current ban, because it was the right thing to do—politically unpopular,
but the right thing. With the current earmark ban in place, Congress
becomes nothing more than a rubber stamp for President Obama’s
spending request, and our opposition to the ban is based on the fact that
this is not how our Founding Fathers envisioned our government. When
writing the U.S. Constitution, they gave Congress, not the executive
branch, the power of the purse.

According to James Madison’s view outlined in the Federalist

Papers, Congress holds this power for the very reason that it is closer to
the people. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story noted in 1833 that if this
authority were given to the president, “the executive would posses an
unbounded power over the public purse of the nation; and might apply all
its monied resources at his pleasure.”

The Constitutional power has been ceded to the president.

What’s worse is the fact that banning Congressional earmarks won’t

save a single taxpayer dime. Instead of saving taxpayer money, the
spending authority is shifted from Congress to the Executive Branch. In
this case, the money is put into the hands of President Obama, to spend
how he sees fit.

Unfortunately, the years of demagoguing earmarks have distracted the

American people from the real fiscal problems that face our nation.

Is it any wonder that Obama supported the big push behind the ban on

congressional earmarks? With Congress out of the way, he is now the
king of earmarks.376

NOW THE GOOD NEWS
There is some good news. Senator John McCain and other conservatives
have joined me in a solution to the earmark issue. We have introduced
legislation to redefine “earmarks” as “an appropriation that has not been
authorized.” That should solve the Congressional earmark problem.377
As Senator McCain stated on the floor, “Some of those earmarks are

worthy. If they are worthy then they should be authorized.”378 He also said,
“You’ve got to get the definition of an earmark: that is, an unauthorized
appropriation.”

And as Senator Coburn (R-OK) said, “It is not wrong to want to help your

state. It is not wrong to go through an authorizing process where your
colleagues actually see it.”379 He and I believe if something is really bad you
have two chances to kill it: in authorization and appropriations.

So, I repeat, the only reason I bring “earmarks” into this book, is because

bureaucratic Obama earmarks—unelected bureaucrats putting grant money
into liberal causes, brainwashing the public—has been a major obstacle I
have had to overcome in combating the hoax.

I will never forget when, years ago, my granddaughter came home from

school and asked, “Why is it you don’t understand global warming?” She had
been brainwashed by a grant. We traced what she had been taught all the way
from the EPA to our public school system in Oklahoma—the false
information was the result of a grant designed to brainwash our kids, using a
bureaucratic earmark.

One of the great frustrations is that it will take years for conservatives and

some talk show hosts to appreciate this chapter. If you ask the vast majority
of talk show hosts, or even newly elected and many long-term members of
Congress to define earmarks, they cannot do it. But, even though they may
know better, many politicians have continued to mischaracterize earmarks,
often out of a desire for personal political gain.

Webster defines a demagogue as “a leader who makes use of popular

prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power.”380
Demagoguery is popular and sends approval numbers soaring.

For the first seven years of my ten-year battle to stop the global warming

cap and trade bills no one would join me because they were convinced
people had already made up their minds. They said taking it on was

politically stupid, and they were right. I went through seven years of misery.
But we won. And we are continuing to win. And we are determined to win
until there are no more global-warming lies, cap-and-tax tricks, and phony-
baloney Obama bureaucratic earmarks to battle.

YOU DECIDE WHO RULES
In the end, this issue of an obvious executive-branch power grab is an issue
the voters will have to decide.

Do you want elected officials to pass laws? These officials are your

representatives, sent to Washington, D.C., to do your business.

Or do you want appointed bureaucrats to establish regulations over which

you have very little recourse?

Again, we need to keep the authorization and appropriation process in the
hands of Congress where the Constitution placed it and go after bureaucratic
earmarks. It is a fact bureaucratic earmarks have been just as much a part of
the global-warming “lie machine” as Al Gore’s movie and they need to be
eradicated the same as Al Gore’s science fiction movie has been refuted.

APPENDIX A

WHAT’S IN IT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS?

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE QUEST FOR
AUTONOMY…WHERE GLOBAL WARMING BEGAN
The United Nations was founded after World War II to replace the League of
Nations. Its expressed purpose at that time, in 1945, was to help nations
work together and talk to avoid wars and promote social progress.381 The
stated aims of the UN have remained fairly stable over the decades, at least
officially. Article 1 of the UN Charter states that the UN is to, among other
things, “maintain international peace and security382 …develop friendly
relations among nations383 … achieve international cooperation in solving
international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian
character,”384 and to serve as “a center for harmonizing the actions of
nations.”385 Nations hoped that by encouraging cooperation on these issues,
countries would be moved toward peaceful relationships instead of warring
ones.

I believe that many globalist elites have worked within the United Nations

to expand its responsibility to an alarming degree. Now, instead of
facilitating international cooperation, I believe the UN’s primary institutional
goal—in practice, if not in word—is to actively build a global utopia. The
UN believes that it can—with enough power and influence— determine what
is best for the world by reaching agreements by majority agreement, or better
yet—consensus—among all of the member states participating at the United
Nations.

Each country represented at the UN has an equal voice.386 No nation—

regardless of their population, landmass, or global influence— has any more
power at the United Nations than another. Each country has one vote.387

When the United Nations works to pass resolutions, it is unwavering in its

desire to do so by consensus. I think that the UN wants all nations to agree
because many elites within the UN believe that where you find agreement,
there you will find peace. If the sum of all nations can agree how to tackle
common problems, then global peace should materialize with relative ease.
The UN proclaims that its adamancy toward reaching agreement by the
consensus of all nations gives it “moral authority” over all other institutions.
This, the UN describes, is one of its “best properties.”388

Over the past several decades, the United Nations has turned much of its

attention to the crafting of solutions for two problems I believe it has
designated as high priorities. It has worked tirelessly to provide a consensus-
based solution for them. The environment is one. Development is the other.
According to the bureaucratic elites at the UN, the environment is on the
brink of disaster. They believe that anywhere you go, you will find evidence
of a global population paying little attention to the impact their activities
have on the environment, and caring even less about the long-term
consequences of those actions.

Concurrently, these elites see billions of people around the world living

in absolute poverty. The global poor—heavily concentrated in the least
developed countries—often live on just dollars a day and have extreme
difficulty living even subsistence lifestyles. All the while, they watch those
in developed nations enjoy the prosperity their wealth provides, but see them
paying little attention to the social dilemma inherent in this inequality.

On a fundamental level, the United Nations elites see three core spheres

of humanity: the society, the economy, and the environment, and they see
major problems in all three. They believe society has little regard for the
inequality across people groups around the world. To them, the global
economic structure appears to be skewed in favor of those already
possessing and consuming most of the world’s resources— leaving little left
over for the poor. The environment has been disregarded by many in favor of
faster economic growth—to the peril of future generations.

The UN elites believe the condition of these three spheres is

unsustainable; they are out of balance; causing inequality; and risking serious,
irreversible damage to the global community. As long as they remain out of
sync, they believe that establishing global utopia will be impossible.
Conflicts—armed or otherwise—will undoubtedly sprout from this

unsustainable trajectory, underscoring the need to develop a workable
solution to reverse this alarming trend.389

Sustainable development is the guiding philosophy that the UN elites have

constructed to solve the structural problems they have identified, and they
seek to use this philosophy to bring complete harmony to each of humanity’s
three spheres.

Doing this will demand fundamental and comprehensive change to a

number of international frameworks, and fully implementing the philosophy
could put the UN on a dangerous path towards autonomy. This is not
something we can allow to happen.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT & SOCIETAL
CHANGES
The United Nations’ elite believe that the core of the environmental problem
facing the world is one of societal outlook. Al Gore articulated this well
when he wrote that the “the twentieth century has not been kind to the
constant human striving for a sense of purpose in life. Two world wars, the
Holocaust, the invention of nuclear weapons, and now the global
environmental crisis have led many of us to wonder if survival—much less
enlightened, joyous, and hopeful living—is possible.”390 He believes—and
the UN elites agree—that this questioning about the future has caused many to
recklessly seek material gain without any regard for the potential
consequences to the environment or society.

Solving this problem at the philosophical level will require the

restoration of faith in the belief that we do have a future that is worth
preparing for. Gore believes this is “essential to [restoring] the balance now
missing in our relationship to the earth.”391

As a lawmaker, I am keenly aware of the challenges facing anyone who

wants to change another person’s behavior. Solving a philosophical problem
rooted in faith will prove impossible for an institution like the UN. But the
UN elites have worked hard to outline the changes they believe need to
happen within the different spheres of society to bring everything back into
balance.

Widespread modern concern for the environment began in the 1960s and

1970s. In 1962, Rachel Carson wrote her landmark book Silent Spring,

questioning the actual benefits of DDT, a widely used pesticide at the time.
The book led to broader public questioning of using pesticides and chemicals
in everyday life.

In 1968, Paul Ehrlich published another influential book, Population

Bomb. In it, he predicted that mass global starvation would occur as a result
of overpopulation. He did not believe that global food production would
expand as rapidly as the global population, a theory he based on the idea that
the earth has a predictable carrying capacity that can sustain only a certain
number of people at a middle-class standard of living. To address the
problem, he recommended the immediate implementation of population
control policies.392

Carson’s theory questioned whether or not all human advancement is truly
beneficial. Ehrlich’s work sparked skepticism that the earth has the ability to
sustain widespread global industrialization. Their common theme is that they
coincided with and heavily influenced a rising concern about humanity’s
overall impact on the environment.

Al Gore is one leader who was impacted by the work of Rachel Carson.

He wrote that dinner table conversations during his childhood about her book
“made an impression” on him because they made him “think about threats to
the environment that are much more serious than washed-out gullies—but
much harder to see.”393 This revelation would make him sympathetic to
emerging global environmental problems like global warming and the ozone
hole, which predicted impending disaster because of the release by humans
of seemingly harmless chemicals and compounds.

Believing that the earth could be heading down a path toward

environmental catastrophe caused the elites within the UN to push for action.

Their involvement formally began with the planning of the 1972

Conference on the Human Environment, which would ultimately serve as the
birthplace of the sustainable development philosophy.

Sustainable development aims to solve the problems caused by

environmental degradation by organizing society in a way that preserves the
present status of the environment. The UN elites believe that doing this will
preserve an environment suitable for future generations to provide for their
own needs. The UN elites further believe that enshrining an environment that
is sustainable demands that the natural systems that support life on earth be

preserved as development occurs. These systems include “the atmosphere,
the waters, the soils, and the living beings.”394

The elites contend that limiting the rate of depletion of nonrenewable

resources is an important component of sustainable development because of
the predictable carrying capacity theory. According to the theory, future
generations will be unable to meet their development needs if today’s needed
resources have been exhausted. Limiting the depletion of nonrenewables to
the lowest level necessary to sustain society is the goal, as it will result in
the longest enjoyment of those resources. Because these resources, like oil
and coal, will eventually be depleted, sustainable development has an
overwhelming bias toward the immediate adoption of renewable resources
and recycling patterns, no matter the cost. The UN elites believe that the
adoption of consumption and production patterns respectful of these trends
will ensure the availability of resources—and therefore equal opportunity—
for future generations.

The predictable carrying capacity theory also doubts the ability of the

earth’s natural systems to support complete industrialization of the world’s
population. In other words, it fears that the unintended consequences of
industrialization, mainly global warming, will push the delicate balance of
the earth out of whack and into disaster.

This presents an interesting ethical dilemma. If the earth cannot handle the

rising living standards of the global poor, should those who are wealthy be
allowed to maintain lavish lifestyles?

The UN elites believe that such intragenerational inequality is unfair. As
such, the UN believes that accomplishing sustainable development requires a
standardization of living standards that is sensitive to the earth’s predicted
carrying capacity. The elites are fully aware that this will demand a
reduction in the living standards of the populations in developed countries.
Our Common Future, a key UN sustainable development document that is
heralded by the elites, states that “living standards that go beyond the basic
minimum are sustainable only if consumption standards everywhere have
regard for long-term sustainability…sustainable development requires the
promotion of values that encourage consumption standards that are within the
bounds of the ecological possible and to which all can reasonably aspire.”395

In other words, the UN elites believe that they need the power to

determine—and enforce—an appropriate global standard of living that is

sensitive to the earth’s predictable carrying capacity. In doing this, the UN
believes it will be able to ensure that no one individual’s development
potential is cut short by the lavish lifestyles of others.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT & CHANGES TO
SOCIETY’S ECONOMIC STRUCTURE
Developing nations have not always gone along with the UN’s plans to limit
their ability to pursue development. This is not surprising. As the home to
most of the global poor, developing nations should be looking for every
development avenue possible to improve the living standards of the people.
Initial discussions leading up to the UN’s first environmental conference,
the 1972 Conference on the Human Environment, were mainly focused on the
problems of the developed world. And because economic growth was seen
by many as a key cause of environmental degradation, some of the solutions
being considered included the idea of slowing economic growth. Developing
nations feared that the effort to limit environmental damage would yield
policy changes that curtailed their ability to develop, which is what they
needed to harness to climb out of poverty. If the fragility of the environment
was the only concern of the conference, then they wanted no part of it, so they
threatened to boycott the event.396

The potential balk by developing nations was important to the UN elites
for one reason: the UN’s desire to craft agreements by majority. Under the
institution’s one-nation, one-vote system, developing nations have
extraordinary power to influence and frame whatever discussion takes place
at the UN. This is because they make up a large majority of the total number
of member states. Without the support of developing nations, a UN resolution
cannot even obtain a simple majority, let alone consensus.

The concentration of this power occurred in 1964 when seventy-seven

nations banded together to create the Group of 77 (G-77). This group works
at the UN to advance the goals and agenda of the developing world. Since
then, its membership has climbed to a total of 131, a significant majority in
the UN’s General Assembly.397

A threat by the G-77 to avoid the 1972 Conference on the Human

Environment, therefore, had to be taken seriously. Without their support, there
would be no way to reach a consensus—or even a majority—and the UN’s

effort to address the global environmental problem would be significantly
weakened.

To garner their support, conference administrators, led by entrepreneur-

turned-environmentalist Maurice Strong, agreed to amend the draft
conference framework so that it would be more inclusive of the developing
world’s concerns. To figure out how to do this, he decided to hold an
informal meeting in Founex, Switzerland, in 1971, where he and the
conference participants would answer any questions and put to rest any
concerns that there may be a conflict of interest between environmental
protection and economic growth/development.398

Strong was able to allay developing nations’ fears by incorporating their

development ideals into the broader fight to save the environment. He did
this by expanding the definition of the word “environment.” The Founex
Panel ultimately resulted in the environment no longer being considered
“simply the biophysical sphere,” but instead it would also include the
“socio-economic structures.” The Founex Panel stated that the bio-
environment and society “[form] an interdependent and inextricable web.”399
No longer would the debate on the environment be “concerned only with
pollution and conservation, nor was the damage to the environment
attributable solely to the process of development. In many cases, the damage
was due to the very same socio-economic forces and causes that were at the
root of poverty, underdevelopment, and inequality, and could be overcome
only through the process of development, economic growth, and social
change.”400

The tangible result of Founex was the modern framework of sustainable
development. It shifted the entire “environmental” debate to become more
centrally focused on the development of impoverished nations.

Throughout the history of the UN, the G-77 has worked to announce its
frustrations with the global economic power structure. In 1974, developing
nations worked together to pass a UN resolution declaring the need to
establish a New International Economic Order.401 In short, the resolution
blames colonialism and the western-style capitalistic system as the root
cause of the impoverished state of their own countries. They point to the fact
that the vast majority of the world’s resources are consumed by a relatively
small group: the people living in industrialized countries. Developing nations
believe this gives them little ability to procure the resources necessary for

development. This was inherent in the Cocoyoc Declaration, which was
made the same year, which states that “pre-emption by the rich of a
disproportionate share of key resources conflicts directly with the longer-
term interests of the poor by impairing their ultimate access to resources
necessary to their development and by increasing their cost.”402 In other
words, they believe the economic development being pursued by developed
nations pushes the price of raw materials up to a level that is unaffordable to
those in developing nations. They believe this limits their potential to
develop.

They further state that the developed nations use their enormous power in

the global economic system to construct trade and other international
agreements to be in their favor, again at the expense of developing nations’
development.

Sustainable development aims to directly combat these challenges to

development that it believes are fostering widespread global inequality by
encouraging the restructuring of the global economic landscape in favor of
developing nations. It also aims to provide more ready and affordable access
to the resources necessary to accomplish development.

Establishing the right to development is one of the key ways that

sustainable development does this. This right demands that all nations and
people be guaranteed the benefits of development. To the extent that
developing nations cannot provide the benefits of development for their
people, sustainable development implies that the global community should
provide it for them.

Because affordable access to raw and other materials is required to
competitively construct goods for trade and consumption, sustainable
development demands that these resources be provided to developing nations
affordably. Access to technology is another resource that must be secured
affordably to take advantage of the maximum benefits of development. To the
extent that individuals in developing nations cannot afford the most advanced
technology available, it should be made available to them for free, or at a
price they can afford.

Because so much of the world’s resources are controlled and consumed

by developed nations, they maintain a dominant hand in international
economics. The UN bureaucracy believes developed nations like the United
States use this influence to unfairly construct trade agreements and

multinational financial institutions, like the IMF, to be overwhelmingly
biased toward their own goals. The UN believes that this causes significant
costs and barriers to development for developing nations. Consequently,
sustainable development demands the realignment of these agreements and
institutions to be overwhelmingly in favor of developing nations so that they
can more easily enjoy the benefits of development.

In short, sustainable development demands the removal of global wealth
and income inequality by completely shifting the global economic landscape
in the favor of developing nations. In many ways, doing this allows the
environmental leaders at the UN to simultaneously accomplish its societal
goals detailed earlier.

The regulation of raw materials and their guaranteed distribution in

accordance with sustainable development needs would require control over
natural resources supplies. To the extent that demand cannot be controlled,
supply must be regulated.

This control over all resources would ultimately allow the UN to reduce
the developed nations’ living standards so that they would be in line with the
UN’s prediction of the world’s carrying capacity. This would protect the
environment. Simultaneously, the UN could redirect the extracted materials
toward the needs of the developing world so that their standards of living can
rise to that set by the earth’s predicted carrying capacity. At its most basic
level, this regime aims to eliminate global inequality through socialism.

Once all people have reached this “sustainable” standard of living, the

UN would then be able to maintain sustainability by directing economic
growth and technological change on a sustainable path, allowing standards of
living to rise only as technological advancement and the discovery of new
resources allow.

Ultimately, the environmental corps at the UN believes that pursuing

sustainable development will reduce conflict and promote peace by restoring
equity to the relationships between the earth and between fellow man. With
sustainable development, there will be no need for conflict, because the
global conditions that so often lead to conflict would be permanently
suspended in harmony.

IMPLEMENTATION & AUTONOMOUS POWER

Considering that the actual implementation of sustainable development is
daunting, it would require nothing short of total control over the earth’s
resources. There is simply no other way to guarantee environmental security,
global equality in living standards, and equal potential for development
across the world.

As discussed before, the UN elites believe that the inherent nature of the
environment’s threat is one that is global and deep within society. Because
the problem is global, the consequences of unsustainable development are
also global. Enacting sustainable development as a corrective instrument
demands a comprehensive shift in the way decisions are made within the
international community so they are responsive to the global problems we
face.

Convincing the world to surrender sovereignty to an international body

will not be easy, and the environmental lobby knows this. History shows that
the global community rarely cooperates in a united way in the absence of an
impending catastrophe. Al Gore once observed that motivating nations to act
collectively “has usually been secured only with the emergence of a life-or-
death threat to the existence of society itself.”403 I believe that this
understanding has led the UN elites to use alarmism to scare the public into
action with the claim that catastrophe will be imminent without immediate
implementation of sustainable development. Without this life-or-death threat
of unsustainable development purported by the United Nations, there would
be no need for their autonomous control over global economic resources.

This is a key reason why the global warming issue fits so perfectly within

the plans of those at the UN who want to use the institution to construct
utopia. Without a tangible, impending disaster, there is no catalyst to act.
Without a catalyst, the UN’s quest to restore equity to relationships and
establish utopia would die.

The formal development of the sustainable development philosophy

occurred over a period of about thirty years, between the late 1960s and the
early 1990s. Since then, the sustainable development philosophy has infected
nearly every United Nations initiative, and the body has used its indefinable
goal of “societal equity” to bring forth policy problems of all sorts so that the
UN can prescribe the solution.

A few examples:

In 1995, the UN held a World Summit for Social Development. The

documents released as a result of the summit directly reference the
establishment of sustainable development as the overriding goal of the
summit’s policy proposals. Among its recommendations is the regulation of
multinational corporations for the purposes of making economic growth more
conducive to social development in developing countries. It also calls into
question the accumulation of wealth, and proposes that it be taxed for the
purposes of improving stability in financial markets, as if it caused instability
in the first place.404

In 1996, the UN held its Second United Nations Summit on Human

Settlements. There, the Summit reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to making
the provision of “adequate shelter” a basic human right. In doing so, it
elevates this issue to the international level, which is unnecessary. To ensure
this right is protected, it states that it is the responsibility of governments to
“enable people to obtain shelter and to protect and improve dwellings.”
While this certainly does not sound bad, it suggests that the government
should be in charge of assigning housing to people of low income. The
conference leader also suggested that each nation cut its defense budget by 5
percent to address the housing needs in an affordable way.405

In 2002, the UN produced a document called “A World Fit for Children”

that reaffirms the rights established for children at the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. It made clear that the right to sexual health privacy is a
necessary element of sustainable development. Without this right enacted,
unsustainable development will ensue, which in their opinion is a bad
thing.406

There is no shortage of alarming changes demanded by the UN in the name

of accomplishing sustainable development, and since launching sustainable
development, the body has stepped well beyond the original intuitions of
what the philosophy should accomplish. It has, in practice, become the catch-
all method by which the UN allows itself to elevate any problem it identifies
within society to the international level. The mentality that it can solve all the
world’s problems and bring about utopia is centered in the philosophy that
governing by the consensus of nations is the surest way to avoid conflict.

WHY WE SHOULDN’T PURSUE SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT AT THE UN

Surrendering sovereignty to an international body like the United Nations so
heavily influenced by environmental elites pursuing a utopian agenda of
sustainable development is a dangerous idea. From the United States’
perspective, the sustainable development agenda provides no benefit.

Its goals to restore relationships between the earth and humanity, and its
attempt to restore equity between and among generations are farfetched and
are not grounded in reality. The societal changes demanded to improve
environmental wellness are all based around the idea that the earth’s carrying
capacity is predictable. I believe that the earth has a carrying capacity to
some degree, but I also believe that our knowledge of the future is severely
limited. Who would have thought two hundred years ago, that we would be
able to feed our entire country with less than two percent of the entire
workforce dedicated to agriculture?407 This has been made possible because
of technological and other advances that have improved our productivity.
Why should we expect this trend to stop?

The Industrial Revolution and the Information Age have made

technological change occur at incredible speeds. Consequently, our demand
for resources changes every minute. Further limiting already limited non-
renewable resources in the name of sustainable development will only push
the price of those materials up as we continue to use them. This will make
products—and development—more expensive, which is the exact opposite
of what many at the UN want sustainable development to do.

The economic changes demanded by the implementation of sustainable
development are equally befuddling. Giving developing nations a right to
development, per se where the international community pitches in to provide
for a country’s needs without regard to the decisions made by those
developing nations, is a bad idea. I believe that it is in the best interest of the
United States to help developing nations prosper. I also believe it is our
moral obligation. Assistance, however, should never come without strings
attached.

In America, we know that our prosperity is a direct result of the

government founded by our forefathers. They understood the value of a stable
government with limited, separated powers, and they insisted that the
freedom of the individual be protected. These are a few of the many
characteristics of our nation that have provided us with significant material
blessing.

Similarly, many nations have pursued highly damaging economic policies
—like totalitarianism and communism—and they have reaped what they have
sown.

Promoting a right to development, where the international community

pitches in and attempts to direct and guarantee prosperity, overlooks this core
truth. Nations must have the ability to choose whatever development path
they want, and they must also live with the consequences of their decisions.
The right to development, by undermining the need for accountability, runs
the risk of propping up bad leaders in foreign countries. If this development
aid is given to nations whose leaders are awful, such that the benefits of aid
can be more easily felt by a nation’s people, then the nation’s people will be
less outraged at the awful decisions made by their own government. This
will dull their appetite to demand leadership changes, which are often
necessary in bad situations like these.

Instead of encouraging a right to development, the United States and other
countries should look to help developing nations improve their institutional
rules, frameworks, and governing philosophies to be friendlier toward
business, tougher on crime, and stable for the long run. Implementing these
changes will go much further to help developing nations take advantage of
development than hand outs and bailouts ever could.

Similarly, the assertion that the wealth of developed nations has caused
the developing nations to be subjected to poverty is wrong. This argument
has been made since at least the mid 1970s, and since that time it has been
refuted. P.T. Bauer, a renowned economist, wrote in 1977 that developing
nations with the most open relationships with developed countries saw the
most economic growth. Nations that were the most isolated—those with the
fewest connections to the West—experienced worse economic growth
compared to their peers.408 For a modern example, we need to go no further
than the Korean Peninsula. North Korea, with a communistic/totalitarian
state, has isolated itself from the world. It is one of the poorest nations on
earth, and its people suffer from severe poverty. South Korea, on the other
hand, is a democracy that values freedom. It has opened itself up to
relationships with the West, and it is now one of the most advanced
economies in the world. This fact single handedly disarms the argument that
the success of developed nations is preventing developing nations from
enjoying the benefits of growth and development.

Economic growth occurs because individuals are free to make decisions

of personal benefit in an open, safe, and reliable society. This means that
there is no need for a centrally controlled system of raw materials. Such a
system might try to shuffle resources from developed nations to developing
nations, but in the end, it will yield an economic system that is irrational and
not properly sensitive to the changing needs and desires of the seven billion
people on the planet.

CONCLUSION
The desire of many to work through the UN to establish utopia under the
ideals of sustainable development is real. The desire is also dangerous. Past
attempts to build utopias have failed miserably, and they have often resulted
in mass murder and genocide. Promoting an agenda that demands the
centralization of power into the hands of a single institution is a recipe for
disaster. We must remain vigilant and aware of what the UN is doing to
accomplish these goals. As you’ve learned from reading this book, the
clearest and most direct way they’re trying to do this is through the global
warming agenda and the pursuit of a Kyoto-like treaty. A treaty of that
magnitude would require a true shift of power from sovereign nations like
our own to the United Nations so that they can determine how to distribute
our wealth and resources around the world—in a way that meets their
definition of “fair.” We must remember to look beyond the headlines and
press releases and do the hard work required to dig deeply into UN
documents to understand their true intentions and motivations. By doing this,
we will be able to more effectively prevent our nation’s sovereignty from
being eroded by the goals of the super-liberals at the United Nations. To that
end, we must demand that the UN remain open and transparent about all that
it does.

Doing anything less will result in a severe threat to our own freedom and

prosperity.

APPENDIX B

EXCERPTS FROM MICHAEL CRICHTON’S

NOVEL: STATE OF FEAR

*All excerpts are copyrighted and printed with permission from Michael

Crichton, State of Fear , Harper Collins, 2004.

EXCERPT #1:
The Political Manipulation of the Science.

Dr. Crichton clearly understood that the science was being manipulated

from the very beginning.

“‘IPCC? What last minute changes?’

“The UN formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the
late 1980s. That’s the IPCC… a huge group of bureaucrats, and scientists
under the thumb of bureaucrats. The idea was that since this was a global
problem, the UN would track climate research and issue reports every
few years. The first assessment report in 1990 said it would be very
difficult to detect a human influence on climate, although everybody was
concerned that one might exist. But the 1995 report announced with
conviction that there was now a ‘discernible human influence’ on
climate.”

“…a discernible human influence’ was written into the 1995 summary

report after the scientists themselves had gone home. Originally, the
document said scientists couldn’t detect a human influence on climate for
sure, and they didn’t know when they would. They said explicitly, ‘we
don’t know.’ That statement was deleted and replaced with a new
statement that a discernible human influence did indeed exist. It was a
major change.”

“… Changing the document caused a stir among scientists at the time,
with opponents and defendants of the change coming forward. If you read
their claims and counter-claims, you can’t be sure who’s telling the truth.
But this is the Internet age. You can find the original documents and the
list of changes online and decide for yourself. A review of the actual text
changes makes it crystal clear that the IPCC is a political organization,
not a scientific one.”

“… When Hansen announced in the summer of 1988 that global
warming was here, he predicted temperatures would increase .35
degrees Celsius over the next ten years.”

“… The actual increase was .11 degrees.”
“And ten years after his testimony, he said that the forces that govern

climate change are so poorly understood that long-term prediction is
impossible.”

“He said, ‘The forces that drive long-term climate change are not
known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change.”

EXCERPT #2:
The Shift from Global Warming to Climate Change.

Dr. Crichton clearly saw the shift in terminology, for political purposes.
Two of the characters in his novel, Drake and Henley, devise a way to keep
money flowing as the issue of global warming loses credibility.

“I hate global warming,” Drake said …

“… You can’t raise a dime with it, especially in winter. Every time it
snows people forget all about global warming. Or else they decide some
warming might be a good thing after all. They’re trudging through the
snow, hoping for a little global warming. It’s not like pollution, John.
Pollution worked. It still works. Pollution scares… people. You tell ‘em
they’ll get cancer, and the money rolls in. But nobody is scared of a little
warming. Especially if it won’t happen for a hundred years.”

“… Species extinction from global warming… They’ve heard that

most of the species that will become extinct are insects. You can’t raise
money on insect extinctions, John. Exotic diseases from global warming
—nobody cares. Hasn’t happened. We ran that huge campaign last year

connecting global warming to the Ebola and Hanta viruses. Nobody went
for it. Sea-level rise from global warming—we all know where that’ll
end up. The Vanutu lawsuit is a… disaster. Everybody’ll assume the sea
level isn’t rising anywhere. And that Scandinavian guy, that sea level
expert. He’s becoming a pest. He’s even attacking the IPCC for
incompetence.”

“… Let me explain how you are going to solve your problem,

Nicholas. The solution is simple. You have already told me that global
warming is unsatisfactory because whenever there is a cold snap, people
forget about it.”

“So what you need,”… “is to structure the information so that

whatever kind of weather occurs, it always confirms your message.
That’s the virtue of shifting the focus to abrupt climate change. It enables
you to use everything that happens. There will always be floods, and
freezing storms, and cyclones, and hurricanes. These events will always
get headlines and airtime. And in every instance, you can claim it as an
example of abrupt climate change caused by global warming. So the
message gets reinforced. The urgency is increased.”

“… It’s not logical to say that freezing weather is caused by global

warming.”

“What’s logic got to do with it?… All we need is for the media to

report it. … The US murder rate is as low as it was in the early 1970s,
but Americans are more frightened than ever, because so much more
airtime is devoted to crime, they naturally assume there is more in real
life too.”

“… Think about what I am saying… A twelve-year trend, and they still

don’t believe it. There is no greater proof that all reality is media
reality.”

“… it’ll be even easier to sell abrupt climate change in Europe than in

the US. You just do it out of Brussels. Because bureaucrats get it, …
They’ll see the advantages of this shift in emphasis.”

EXCERPT #3:
The Press-Driven Agenda.

The plain and simple formula of the media business is that money is made
when ratings are enhanced, and one of the sure-fire ways of boosting ratings

is to introduce a strong fear factor. Dr. Crichton captures this sense of self-
importance on the part of media personnel as few other authors ever have.
The scene below involves three media skeptics.

Then the anchors came back onscreen, and one of the men said, “Flood
advisories remain in effect, even though it is unseasonable for this time of
year.”

“Looks like the weather’s changing,” the anchorwoman said, tossing

her hair.

“Yes, Marla, there is no question the weather is changing. And here,

with that story, is our own Johnny Rivera.”

They cut to a younger man, apparently the weatherman. “Thanks, Terry.

Hi, everybody. If you’re a longtime resident of the Grand Canyon State,
you’ve probably noticed that our weather is changing, and scientists have
confirmed that what’s behind it is our old culprit, global warming.
Today’s flash flood is just one example of the trouble ahead—more
extreme weather conditions, like floods and tornadoes and droughts—all
as a result of global warming.”

Sanjong nudged Evans, and handed him a sheet of paper. It was a

printout of a press release from the NERF website. Sanjong pointed to
the text: “… scientists agree there will be trouble ahead: more extreme
weather events, like floods and tornadoes and drought, all as a result of
global warming.”

Evans said, “This guy’s just reading a press release?”
“That’s how they do it, these days,” Kenner said. “They don’t even

bother to change a phrase here and there. They just read the copy outright.
And of course, what he’s saying is not true.”

“Then what’s causing the increase in extreme weather around the

world?” Evans said.

“There is no increase in extreme weather.”
“That’s been studied?”
“Repeatedly. The studies show no increase in extreme weather events

over the past century. Or in the last fifteen years. And the GCMs don’t
predict more extreme weather. If anything, global warming theory
predicts less extreme weather.”

Onscreen, the weatherman was saying, “it is becoming so bad, that the

latest news is—get this—glaciers on Greenland are melting away and
will soon vanish entirely. Those glaciers are three miles thick, folks.
That’s a lotta ice. A new study estimate sea levels will rise twenty feet or
more. So sell that beach property now.”

Evans said, ‘What about that one? It was on the news in LA

yesterday.”

“I wouldn’t call it news,” Kenner said. “Scientists at Reading ran
computer simulations that suggested that Greenland might lose its ice
pack in the next thousand years.”
“Thousand years?” Evans said.
“Might.”
Evans pointed to the television. “He didn’t say it could happen a

thousand years from now.”

“Imagine that,” Kenner said. “He left that one out.”
“But you said it isn’t news…”
“You tell me,” Kenner said, “Do you spend much time worrying about

what might happen a thousand years from now?”

“No.”
“Think anybody should?”
“No.”
“There you are.”

EXCERPT #4:
The Rising Role of Hollywood.

In the novel, Dr. Crichton’s character Ted Bradley is portrayed in a role

that accurately demonstrates how Hollywood actors rejoice in letting
themselves be used to influence public opinion.

The forest floor was dark and cool. Shafts of sunlight filtered down from
the magnificent trees rising all around them. The air smelled of pine. The
ground was soft underfoot.

It was a pleasant spot, with sunlight dappling the forest floor, but even
so the television cameras had to turn on their lights to film the third-grade
schoolchildren who sat in concentric circles around the famous actor and

activist Ted Bradley. Bradley was wearing a black T-shirt that set off his
makeup and his dark good looks.

“These glorious trees are your birthright,” he said, gesturing all around
him. “They have been standing here for centuries. Long before you were
born, before your parents or your grandparents or your great-
grandparents were born. Some of them, before Columbus came to
America! Before the Indians came! Before anything! These trees are the
oldest living things on the planet; they are the guardians of the Earth; they
are wise; and they have a message for us: Leave the planet alone. Don’t
mess with it, or with us. And we must listen to them.”

The kids stared open-mouthed, transfixed. The cameras were trained

on Bradley.

“But now these magnificent trees—having survived the threat of fire,
the threat of logging, the threat of soil erosion, the threat of acid rain—
now face their greatest threat ever. Global warming. You kids know what
global warming is, don’t you?”

Hands went up all around the circle. “I know, I know!”
“I’m glad you do,” Bradley said, gesturing for the kids to put their

hands down. The only person talking today would be Ted Bradley. “But
you may not know that global warming is going to cause a very sudden
change in our climate. Maybe just a few months or years, and it will
suddenly be much hotter or much colder. And there will be hordes of
insects and diseases that will take down these wonderful trees.”

“What kind of insects?” one kid asked.
“Bad ones,” Bradley said. “The ones that eat trees, that worm inside
them and chew them up.” He wiggled his hands, suggesting the worming
in progress.

“It would take an insect a long time to eat a whole tree,” a girl offered.
“No, it wouldn’t!” Bradley said. “That’s the trouble. Because global

warming means lots and lots of insects will come—a plague of insects—
and they’ll eat the trees fast!”

Standing to one side, Jennifer leaned close to Evans. “Do you believe

this…?”

Evans yawned. He had slept on the flight up, and had dozed off again

in the ride from the airport to this grove in Sequoia National Park. He felt
groggy now, looking at Bradley. Groggy and bored.

By now the kids were fidgeting, and Bradley turned squarely to the

cameras. He spoke with the easy authority he had mastered while playing
the president for so many years on television. “The threat of abrupt
climate change,” he said, “is so devastating for mankind, and for all life
on this planet, that conferences are being convened all around the world
to deal with it. There is a conference in Los Angeles starting tomorrow,
where scientists will discuss what we can do to mitigate this terrible
threat. But if we do nothing, catastrophe looms. And these mighty,
magnificent trees will be a memory, a postcard from the past, a snapshot
of man’s inhumanity to the natural world. We’re responsible for
catastrophic climate change. And only we can stop it.”

He finished, with a slight turn to favor his good side, and a piercing

stare, from his baby blues, right into the lens.

She continued. “At first, arctic grasses and shrubs were the only plants

that could take hold in the barren glacial soil. But when they died they
decomposed, and over thousands of years a layer of topsoil built up. And
that initiated a sequence of plant colonization that was basically the same
everywhere in post-glacial North America.

“First, lodgepole pine comes in. That’s around fourteen thousand years
ago. Later it’s joined by spruce, hemlock, and alder—trees that are hardy
but can’t be first. These trees constitute the real ‘primary’ forest, and they
dominated this landscape for the next four thousand years. Then the
climate changed. It got much warmer, and all the glaciers in California

… “Twenty thousand years ago, the Ice Age glaciers receded from
California, gouging out Yosemite Valley and other beauty spots as they
left. As the ice walls withdrew, they left behind a gunky, damp plain with
lots of lakes fed by the melting glaciers, but no vegetation at all. It was
basically wet sand.

“After a few thousand years, the land dried as the glaciers continued to
move farther north. This region of California became arctic tundra, with
tall grasses supporting little animals, like mice and squirrels. Human
beings had arrived here by then, hunting the small animals and setting
fires.”

“Okay so far?” Jennifer said. “No primeval forests yet.”
“I’m listening,” Ted growled. He was clearly trying to control his

temper.

melted. There were no glaciers at all in California back then. It was
warm and dry, there were lots of fires, and the primary forest burned. It
was replaced by a plains-type vegetation of oak trees and prairie herbs.
And a few Douglas fir trees, but not many, because the climate was too
dry for fir trees.

“Then, around six thousand years ago, the climate changed again. It
became wetter, and the Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar moved in and
took over the land, creating the great closed-canopy forests that you see
now. But someone might refer to these fir trees as a pest plant—an
oversized weed—that invaded the landscape, crowding out the native
plants that had been there before them. Because these big canopy forests
made the ground too dark for other trees to survive. And since there were
frequent fires, the closed-canopy forests were able to spread like mad.
So they’re not timeless, Ted. They’re merely the last in line.”

Bradley snorted. “They’re still 6 thousand years old…”
But Jennifer was relentless. “Not true,” she said. “Scientists have
shown that the forests continuously changed their composition. Each
thousand-year period was different from the one before it. The forests
changed constantly, Ted. And then, of course, there were the Indians.”

“What about them?” …
“The Indians were expert observers of the natural world, so they

realized that old-growth forests sucked. Those forests may look
impressive, but they’re dead landscapes for game. So the Indians set
fires, making sure the forests burned down periodically. They made sure
there were only islands of old-growth forest in the midst of plains and
meadows. The forests that the first Europeans saw were hardly primeval.
They were cultivated, Ted. And it’s not surprising that one hundred fifty
years ago, there was less old-growth forest than there is today. The
Indians were realists. Today, it’s all romantic mythology.” …

After a while, Bradley excused himself and went to the front of the
plane to call his agent. Evans said to Jennifer, “How did you know all
that stuff?”

“For the reason Bradley himself mentioned. The ‘dire threat of global

warming.’ We had a whole team researching dire threats. Because we
wanted to find everything we could to make our case as impressive as
possible.”

“And?”
She shook her head. “The threat of global warming,” she said, “is
essentially nonexistent. Even if it were a real phenomenon, it would
probably result in a net benefit.”

A SAMPLING OF EMAILS AND DOCUMENTS
The following is a preliminary sampling of CRU emails and documents
which I believe seriously compromise the IPCC-backed “consensus” and its
central conclusion that anthropogenic emissions are inexorably leading to

environmental catastrophes, and which represent unethical and possibly
illegal conduct by top IPCC scientists, among others. In the interest of
brevity, many of the emails are not reproduced in their entirety. Therefore,
the reader is encouraged to seek outside sources for broader review and
context of the exposed emails and documents. The emails are reproduced in
chronological order from oldest to newest on a variety of topics related to
the participant’s global warming research. These emails have been widely
circulated:

Attached are the calibration residual series for experiments based on

I can’t find the one for the network back to 1820! But basically, you’ll
see that the residuals are pretty red for the first 2 cases, and then not
significantly red for the 3rd case--its even a bit better for the AD 1700
and 1820 cases, but I can’t seem to dig them up… . p.s. I know I probably
don’t need to mention this, but just to insure absolutely clarify on this, I’m
providing these for your own personal use, since you’re a trusted

Thanks for the email. Steve McIntyre hasn’t contacted me directly about
Law Dome (yet), nor about any of the series used in the 1998 Holocene
paper or the 2003 GRL one with Mike. I suspect (hope) that he won’t. I
had some emails with him a few years ago when he wanted to get all the
station temperature data we use here in CRU. I hid behind the fact that
some of the data had been received from individuals and not directly
from Met Services through the Global Telecommunications Service
(GTS) or through GCOS. I’ve cc’d Mike on this, just for info. Emails
have also been sent to some other paleo people asking for datasets used
in 1998 or 2003. Keith Briffa here got one, for example. Here, they have
also been in contact with some of Keith’s Russian contacts. All seem to
relate to trying to get series we’ve used.

Thanks for the quick reply. The leaflet appeared so general, but it was
prepared by UEA so they may have simplified things. From their
wording, computer code would be covered by the FOIA. My concern
was if Sarah is/was still employed by UEA. I guess she could claim that
she had only written one tenth of the code and release every tenth line.
Sorry I won’t see you, but I will not come up to Norwich until Monday.

… As for FOIA Sarah isn’t technically employed by UEA [University of
East Anglia] and she will likely be paid by Manchester Metropolitan
University. I wouldn’t worry about the code. If FOIA does ever get used
by anyone, there is also IPR [intellectual property rights] to consider as
well. Data is covered by all the agreements we sign with people, so I
will be hiding behind them. I’ll be passing any requests onto the person at
UEA who has been given a post to deal with them.

[Subject: For your eyes only]
Mike,

I presume congratulations are in order—so congrats etc ! Just sent loads
of station data to Scott. Make sure he documents everything better this
time ! And don’t leave stuff lying around on ftp [file transfer protocol]
sites—you never know who is trawling them. The two MMs have been
after the CRU station data for years. If they ever hear there is a Freedom
of Information Act now in the UK, I think I’ll delete the file rather than
send to anyone. Does your similar act in the US force you to respond to
enquiries within 20 days?—our does ! The UK works on precedents, so
the first request will test it. We also have a data protection act, which I
will hide behind. Tom Wigley has sent me a worried email when he
heard about it—thought people could ask him for his model code. He has
retired officially from UEA so he can hide behind that. IPR [intellectual
property rights] should be relevant here, but I can see me getting into an
argument with someone at UEA who’ll say we must adhere to it !

From: Michael E. Mann [University of Virginia]
To: Phil Jones [CRU]
February 2, 2005
Thanks Phil,
Yes, we’ve learned out lesson about FTP. We’re going to be very careful
in the future what gets put there. Scott really screwed up big time when
he established that directory so that Tim could access the data. Yeah,
there is a freedom of information act in the U.S., and the contrarians are
going to try to use it for all its worth. But there are also intellectual
property rights issues, so it isn’t clear how these sorts of things will play
out ultimately in the U.S. I saw the paleo draft (actually I saw an early
version, and sent Keith some minor comments). It looks very good at
present—will be interesting to see how they deal w/the contrarian
criticisms—there will be many. I’m hoping they’ll stand firm (I believe
they will—I think the chapter has the right sort of personalities for that)

… Thinking about the final bit for the Appendix. Keith should be in later,
so I’ll check with him—and look at that vineyard book. I did rephrase the
bit about the ‘evidence’ as Lamb refers to it. I wanted to use his phrasing
—he used this word several times in these various papers. What he
means is his mind and its inherent bias(es). Your final sentence though
about improvements in reviewing and traceability is a bit of a hostage to

fortune. The skeptics will try to hang on to something, but I don’t want to
give them something clearly tangible. Keith/Tim still getting FOI requests
as well as MOHC [Meteorological Office Hadley Center] and Reading.
All our FOI officers have been in discussions and are now using the same
exceptions not to respond—advice they got from the Information
Commissioner… . The FOI line we’re all using is this. IPCC is exempt
from any countries FOI—the skeptics have been told this. Even though
we (MOHC, CRU/UEA) possibly hold relevant info the IPCC is not part
our remit (mission statement, aims etc) therefore we don’t have an
obligation to pass it on.

Dear All,

Apologies for sending this again. I was expecting a stack of emails this
morning in response, but I inadvertently left Mike off (mistake in pasting)
and picked up Tom’s old address. Tom is busy though with another
offspring ! I looked briefly at the paper last night and it is appalling—
worst word I can think of today without the mood pepper appearing on
the email ! I’ll have time to read more at the weekend as I’m coming to
the US for the DoE CCPP meeting at Charleston. Added Ed, Peck and
Keith A. onto this list as well. I would like to have time to rise to the
bait, but I have so much else on at the moment. As a few of us will be at
the EGS/AGU meet in Nice, we should consider what to do there. The
phrasing of the questions at the start of the paper determine the answer
they get. They have no idea what multiproxy averaging does. By their
logic, I could argue 1998 wasn’t the warmest year globally, because it
wasn’t the warmest everywhere. With their LIA [Little Ice Age] being
1300-1900 and their MWP [Medieval Warm Period] 800-1300, there
appears (at my quick first reading) no discussion of synchroneity of the
cool/warm periods. Even with the instrumental record, the early and late
20th century warming periods are only significant locally at between 10-
20% of grid boxes. Writing this I am becoming more convinced we
should do something—even if this is just to state once and for all what
we mean by the LIA and MWP. I think the skeptics will use this paper to
their own ends and it will set paleo[climatology] back a number of years
if it goes unchallenged. I will be emailing the journal to tell them I’m
having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this
troublesome editor. A CRU person is on the editorial board, but papers
get dealt with by the editor assigned by Hans von Storch.

Subject: Re: Fwd: Soon & Baliunas
Thanks Phil,
(Tom: Congrats again!)
The Soon & Baliunas paper couldn’t have cleared a ‘legitimate’ peer
review process anywhere. That leaves only one possibility—that the
peer-review process at Climate Research has been hijacked by a few
skeptics on the editorial board. And it isn’t just De Frietas, unfortunately
I think this group also includes a member of my own department… The
skeptics appear to have staged a ‘coup’ at “Climate Research” (it was a
mediocre journal to begin with, but now its a mediocre journal with a
definite ‘purpose’). Folks might want to check out the editors and review
editors: [1]http://www.int-res.com/journals/cr/crEditors.html In fact,
Mike McCracken first pointed out this article to me, and he and I have
discussed this a bit. I’ve cc’d Mike in on this as well, and I’ve included
Peck too. I told Mike that I believed our only choice was to ignore this
paper. They’ve already achieved what they wanted—the claim of a peer-
reviewed paper. There is nothing we can do about that now, but the last
thing we want to do is bring attention to this paper, which will be ignored
by the community on the whole… It is pretty clear that thee skeptics here
have staged a bit of a coup, even in the presence of a number of
reasonable folks on the editorial board (Whetton, Goodess, …). My
guess is that Von Storch is actually with them (frankly, he’s an odd
individual, and I’m not sure he isn’t himself somewhat of a skeptic
himself), and without Von Storch on their side, they would have a very
forceful personality promoting their new vision. There have been several
papers by Pat Michaels, as well as the Soon & Baliunas paper, that
couldn’t get published in a reputable journal. This was the danger of
always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the “peer-reviewed
literature”. Obviously, they found a solution to that--take over a journal!
So what do we do about this? I think we have to stop considering
“Climate Research” as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we
should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no
longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal. We would also need to
consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who
currently sit on the editorial board… What do others think?

HI Malcolm,
Thanks for the feedback--I largely concur. I do, though, think there is a
particular problem with “Climate Research”. This is where my colleague
Pat Michaels now publishes exclusively, and his two closest colleagues

we’ll see more of this there, and I personally think there *is* a bigger
problem with the “messenger” in this case…

Dear All,
I agree with all the points being made and the multi-authored article
would be a good idea, but how do we go about not letting it get buried
somewhere. Can we not address the misconceptions by finally coming up
with definitive dates for the LIA and MWP and redefining what we think
the terms really mean? With all of us and more on the paper, it should
carry a lot of weight. In a way we will be setting the agenda for what
should be being done over the next few years…

Subject: My turn
… This second case gets to the crux of the matter. I suspect that deFreitas
deliberately chose other referees who are members of the skeptics camp.
I also suspect that he has done this on other occasions. How to deal with
this is unclear, since there are a number of individuals with bona fide
scientific credentials who could be used by an unscrupulous editor to

ensure that ‘anti-greenhouse’ science can get through the peer review
process (Legates, Balling, Lindzen, Baliunas, Soon, and so on). The peer
review process is being abused, but proving this would be difficult. The
best response is, I strongly believe, to rebut the bad science that does get

clearly giving good science a bad name, but I do not think a barrage of ad
hominem attacks or letters is the best way to counter this. If Jim wishes to
write a letter with multiple authors, I may be willing to sign it, but I
would not write such a letter myself. In this case, deFreitas is such a poor
scientist that he may simply disappear. I saw some work from his PhD,
and it was awful (Pat Michaels’ PhD is at the same level).

… A letter to OSTP [White House Office of Science and Technology

interest in this paper, OSTP really does need to receive a measured,
critical discussion of flaws in Soon and Baliunas’ methods. I agree with
Tom that a noted group from the detection and attribution effort such as
Mann, Crowley, Briffa, Bradley, Jones and Hughes should spearhead
such a letter. Many others of us could sign on in support. This would
provide Dave Halpern with the ammunition he needs to provide the
White House with the needed documentation that hopefully will dismiss
this paper for the slipshod work that it is. Such a letter could be
developed in parallel with a rebuttal article…

go through two Editors rather than one, the former to have overall
responsibility, the latter to provide a second opinion on a paper and
reviewers’ comments prior to publication. A General Editor would be
needed to adjudicate in the event of disagreement. Of course, this could
then slow down the review process enormously. However, without an
editorial board to vote someone off, how can suspect Editors be removed
except by the Publisher (in this case, Inter-Research).

publication of crap science ‘in order to stimulate debate’. One approach
is to go direct to the publishers and point out the fact that their journal is
perceived as being a medium for disseminating misinformation under the
guise of refereed work. I use the word ‘perceived’ here, since whether it
is true or not is not what the publishers care about—it is how the journal
is seen by the community that counts. I think we could get a large group of
highly credentialed scientists to sign such a letter—50+ people. Note that
I am copying this view only to Mike Hulme and Phil Jones. Mike’s idea
to get editorial board members to resign will probably not work—must
get rid of von Storch too, otherwise holes will eventually fill up with
people like Legates, Balling, Lindzen, Michaels, Singer, etc. I have heard
that the publishers are not happy with von Storch, so the above approach

Hi Keith,

Okay, today. Promise! Now something to ask from you. Actually
somewhat important too. I got a paper to review (submitted to the Journal
of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Sciences), written by a
Korean guy and someone from Berkeley, that claims that the method of
reconstruction that we use in dendroclimatology (reverse regression) is
wrong, biased, lousy, horrible, etc. They use your Tornetrask recon as the
main whipping boy… . I would like to play with it in an effort to refute
their claims. If published as is, this paper could really do some damage.
It is also an ugly paper to review because it is rather mathematical, with
a lot of Box-Jenkins stuff in it. It won’t be easy to dismiss out of hand as
the math appears to be correct theoretically but it suffers from the classic
problem of pointing out theoretical deficiencies … I am really sorry but I
have to nag about that review—Confidentially I now need a hard and if
required extensive case for rejecting—to support Dave Stahle’s and

Only have it in the pdf form. FYI ONLY—don’t pass on. Relevant paras
are the last 2 in section 4 on p13. As I said it is worded carefully due to
Adrian knowing Eugenia for years. He knows the’re wrong, but he
succumbed to her almost pleading with him to tone it down as it might
affect her proposals in the future ! I didn’t say any of this, so be careful
how you use it—if at all. Keep quiet also that you have the pdf. The
attachment is a very good paper—I’ve been pushing Adrian over the last
weeks to get it submitted to JGR [Journal of Geophysical Research] or J.
Climate [Journal of Climate]. The main results are great for CRU and
also for ERA-40. The basic message is clear—you have to put enough
surface and sonde obs into a model to produce Reanalyses. The jumps
when the data input change stand out so clearly. NCEP does many odd
things also around sea ice and over snow and ice… . The other paper by
MM is just garbage—as you knew. De Freitas again. Pielke is also losing
all credibility as well by replying to the mad Finn as well—frequently as
I see it. I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report.
Kevin and I will keep them out somehow—even if we have to redefine
what the peer-review literature is!

     Mike,
For your interest, there is an ECMWF ERA-40 Report coming out soon,
which shows that Kalnay and Cai are wrong. It isn’t that strongly worded

as the first author is a personal friend of Eugenia. The result is rather
hidden in the middle of the report. It isn’t peer review, but a slimmed
down version will go to a journal. KC are wrong because the difference
between NCEP and real surface temps (CRU) over eastern N. America
doesn’t happen with ERA-40. ERA-40 assimilates surface temps (which
NCEP didn’t) and doing this makes the agreement with CRU better. Also
ERA-40’s trends in the lower atmosphere are all physically consistent
where NCEP’s are not—over eastern US. I can send if you want, but it
won’t be out as a report for a couple of months.

In your recent email to Chris Reason, you laid out your concerns that I
presume were the reason for your phone call to me last week. I have
reviewed the manuscript by McIntyre, as well as the reviews. The editor
in this case was Prof. James Saiers. He did note initially that the
manuscript did challenge published work, and so felt the need for an
extensive and thorough review. For that reason, he requested reviews
from 3 knowledgable scientists. All three reviews recommended
publication. While I do agree that this manuscript does challenge
(somewhat aggresively) some of your past work, I do not feel that it takes
a particularly harsh tone. On the other hand, I can understand your
reaction. As this manuscript was not written as a Comment, but rather as
a full-up scientific manuscript, you would not in general be asked to look
it over. And I am satisfied by the credentials of the reviewers. Thus, I do
not feel that we have sufficient reason to interfere in the timely
publication of this work. However, you are perfectly in your rights to
write a Comment, in which you challenge the authors’ arguments and
assertions. Should you elect to do this, your Comment would be provided

to them and they would be offered the chance to write a Reply. Both
Comment and Reply would then be reviewed and published together (if
they survived the review process). Comments are limited to the

Hi Malcolm,
This assumes that the editor/s in question would act in good faith. I’m not
convinced of this. I don’t believe a response in GRL is warranted in any
case. The MM claims in question are debunked in other papers that are in
press and in review elsewhere. I’m not sure that GRL can be seen as an
honest broker in these debates anymore, and it is probably best to do an
end run around GRL now where possible. They have published far too
many deeply flawed contrarian papers in the past year or so. There is no
possible excuse for them publishing all 3 Douglass papers and the Soon

Given this, I would like to add my own opinion developed through the
weekend. First let me say that in general, as my own opinion, I feel rather
unconfortable about using not only unpublished but also un reviewed
material as the backbone of our conclusions (or any conclusions). I
realize that chapter 9 is including SRES stuff, and thus we can and need
to do that too, but the fact is that in doing so the rules of IPCC have been
softened to the point that in this way the IPCC is not any more an
assessment of published science (which is its proclaimed goal) but
production of results. The softened condition that the models themself
have to be published does not even apply because the Japanese model for
example is very different from the published one which gave results not
even close to the actual outlier version (in the old dataset the CCC model
was the outlier). Essentially, I feel that at this point there are very little
rules and almost anything goes. I think this will set a dangerous precedent
which might mine the IPCC credibility, and I am a bit uncomfortable that

now nearly everybody seems to think that it is just ok to do this.
Anyways, this is only my opinion for what it is worth.

cold seasons. The discussion of uncertainties in tree ring reconstructions
should be direct, not referred to other references—it’s important for this
document. How the long-term growth is factored in/out should be
mentioned as a prime problem. The lack of tropical data—a few corals
prior to 1700—has got to be discussed. The primary criticism of
McIntyre and McKitrick, which has gotten a lot of play on the Internet, is
that Mann et al. transformed each tree ring prior to calculating PCs by
subtracting the 1902-1980 mean, rather than using the length of the full
time series (e.g., 1400-1980), as is generally done. M&M claim that
when they used that procedure with a red noise spectrum, it always
resulted in a ‘hockey stick’. Is this true? If so, it constitutes a devastating
criticism of the approach; if not, it should be refuted. While IPCC cannot

considered relates to the fact that the PC1 time series in the Mann et al.

(on the assumption—following an earlier paper by Lamarche et al.—that
this incressing growth was evidence of carbon dioxide fertilization), by
differencing the data from another record produced by other workers in
northern Alaska and Canada (which incidentally was standardised in a
totally different way). This last adjustment obviously will have a large
influence on the quantification of the link between these Western US trees

Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs [Sea Surface

the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip (as
I’m sure you know). So, if we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, 0.15

degC, then this would be significant for the global mean—but we’d still
have to explain the land blip. I’ve chosen 0.15 here deliberately. This
still leaves an ocean blip, and i think one needs to have some form of
ocean blip to explain the land blip (via either some common forcing, or
ocean forcing land, or vice versa, or all of these). When you look at other
blips, the land blips are 1.5 to 2 times (roughly) the ocean blips—higher
sensitivity plus thermal inertia effects. My 0.15 adjustment leaves things
consistent with this, so you can see where I am coming from… .

Phil,
It is distressing to read that American Stinker item [Oct. 5th article from
the American Thinker which highlights Stephen McIntyre’s discovery that
Keith Briffa apparently cherry picked data regarding tree-rings from
Yamal]. But Keith does seem to have got himself into a mess. As I
pointed out in emails, Yamal is insignificant. And you say that (contrary
to what M&M say) Yamal is *not* used in MBH, etc. So these facts alone
are enough to shoot down M&M is a few sentences (which surely is the
only way to go—complex and wordy responses will be counter
productive). But, more generally, (even if it *is* irrelevant) how does
Keith explain the McIntyre plot that compares Yamal-12 with Yamal-all?
And how does he explain the apparent “selection” of the less well-
replicated chronology rather that the later (better replicated) chronology?
Of course, I don’t know how often Yamal-12 has really been used in
recent, post-1995, work. I suspect from what you say it is much less often
that M&M say—but where did they get their information? I presume they
went thru papers to see if Yamal was cited, a pretty foolproof method if
you ask me. Perhaps these things can be explained clearly and concisely
—but I am not sure Keith is able to do this as he is too close to the issue
and probably quite pissed of. And the issue of with-holding data is still a
hot potato, one that affects both you and Keith (and Mann). Yes, there are
reasons—but many *good* scientists appear to be unsympathetic to these.
The trouble here is that with-holding data looks like hiding something,

and hiding means (in some eyes) that it is bogus science that is being
hidden. I think Keith needs to be very, very careful in how he handles
this. I’d be willing to check over anything he puts together.

Hi Keith,
I will start out by sending you the chronologies that I sent Bradley, i.e. all
but Mongolia. If you can talk Gordon out of the latter, you’ll be the first
from outside this lab. The chronologies are in tabbed column format and
Tucson index format. The latter have sample size included. It doesn’t take

a rocket scientist (or even Bradley after I warned him about small sample
size problems) to realize that some of the chronologies are down to only
1 series in their earliest parts. Perhaps I should have truncated them
before using them, but I just took what Jan gave me and worked with the
chronologies as best I could. My suspicion is that most of the pre-1200
divergence is due to low replication and a reduced number of available
chronologies. I should also say that the column data have had their means
normalized to approximately 1.0, which is not the case for the
chronologies straight out of ARSTAN. That is because the site-level
RCS-detrended data were simply averaged to produce these
chronologies, without concern for their long-term means. Hence the
“RAW” tag at the end of each line of indices. Bradley still regards the
MWP [Medieval Warm Period] as “mysterious” and “very incoherent”
(his latest pronouncement to me) based on the available data. Of course
he and other members of the MBH [Mann Bradley Hughes] camp have a
fundamental dislike for the very concept of the MWP, so I tend to view
their evaluations as starting out from a somewhat biased perspective, i.e.
the cup is not only “half-empty”; it is demonstrably “broken”. I come
more from the “cup half-full” camp when it comes to the MWP, maybe
yes, maybe no, but it is too early to say what it is. Being a natural skeptic,
I guess you might lean more towards the MBH camp, which is fine as
long as one is honest and open about evaluating the evidence (I have my
doubts about the MBH camp). We can always politely(?) disagree given
the same admittedly equivocal evidence. I should say that Jan should at
least be made aware of this reanalysis of his data. Admittedly, all of the
Schweingruber data are in the public domain I believe, so that should not
be an issue with those data. I just don’t want to get into an open critique
of the Esper data because it would just add fuel to the MBH attack squad.
They tend to work in their own somewhat agenda-filled ways. We should
also work on this stuff on our own, but I do not think that we have an
agenda per se, other than trying to objectively understand what is going
on. Cheers, Ed

Can I just say that I am not in the MBH [Mann Bradley Hughes] camp—if
that be characterized by an unshakable “belief” one way or the other,
regarding the absolute magnitude of the global MWP [Medieval Warm
Period]. I certainly believe the “medieval” period was warmer than the
18th century—the equivalence of the warmth in the post 1900 period, and
the post 1980s, compared to the circa Medieval times is very much still
an area for much better resolution. I think that the geographic/seasonal
biases and dating/response time issues still cloud the picture of when and
how warm the Medieval period was . On present evidence, even with
such uncertainties I would still come out favouring the “likely
unprecedented recent warmth” opinion—but our motivation is to further
explore the degree of certainty in this belief—based on the realistic
interpretation of available data. Point re Jan well taken and I will inform
him

Taken together, the sparse evidence of Southern Hemisphere temperatures
prior to the period of instrumental records indicates that overall warming
has occurred during the last 350 years, but the even fewer longer regional
records indicate earlier periods that are as warm, or warmer than, 20th
century means….
Peck, you have to consider that since the TAR [IPCC Third Assessment
Report], there has been a lot of argument re “hockey stick” and the real
independence of the inputs to most subsequent analyses is minimal. True,
there have been many different techniques used to aggregate and scale

data—but the efficacy of these is still far from established. We should be
careful not to push the conclusions beyond what we can securely justify
—and this is not much other than a confirmation of the general
conclusions of the TAR . We must resist being pushed to present the
results such that we will be accused of bias—hence no need to attack
Moberg . Just need to show the “most likely” course of temperatures over
the last 1300 years—which we do well I think. Strong confirmation of
TAR is a good result, given that we discuss uncertainty and base it on
more data. Let us not try to over egg the pudding. For what it worth, the
above comments are my (honestly long considered) views—and I would
not be happy to go further . Of course this discussion now needs to go to

… Well, yes and no. If the mismatch between suggested forcing, model
sensitivity, and suggested response for the LIA suggests the forcing is
overestimated (in particular the solar forcing), then it makes an earlier
warm period less likely, with little implication for future warming. If it
suggests climate sensitivity is really much lower, then it says nothing
about the earlier warm period (could still have been driven by solar
forcing), but suggests future warming is overestimated. If however it

implies the reconstructions are underestimating past climate changes, then
it suggests the earlier warm period may well have been warmer than

climate changes will be large. This is the essence of the problem. David

There has been some email traffic in the last few days to a week—quite a
bit really, only a small part about MSU. The main part has been one of
your House subcommittees wanting Mike Mann and others and IPCC to
respond on how they produced their reconstructions and how IPCC
produced their report. In case you want to look at this see later in the
email ! Also this load of rubbish ! This is from an Australian at BMRC
[Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre] (not Neville Nicholls). It
began from the attached article. What an idiot. The scientific community
would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had
cooled from 1998. OK it has but it is only 7 years of data and it isn’t
statistically significant.

… The Hadley Centre are working on the day/night issue with sondes,
but there are a lot of problems as there are very few sites in the tropics
with both and where both can be distinguished. My own view if that the
sondes are overdoing the cooling wrt MSU4 in the lower stratosphere,
and some of this likely (IPCC definition) affects the upper troposphere as
well. Sondes are a mess and the fact you get agreement with some of
them is miraculous. Have you looked at individual sondes, rather than
averages—particularly tropical ones? LKS is good, but the RATPAC
update less so.

… What will be interesting is to see how IPCC pans out, as we’ve been
told we can’t use any article that hasn’t been submitted by May 31. This
date isn’t binding, but Aug 12 is a little more as this is when we must
submit our next draft—the one everybody will be able to get access to
and comment upon. The science isn’t going to stop from now until AR4

[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report] comes out in early 2007, so we are
going to have to add in relevant new and important papers. I hope it is up
to us to decide what is important and new. So, unless you get something
to me soon, it won’t be in this version. It shouldn’t matter though, as it
will be ridiculous to keep later drafts without it. We will be open to
criticism though with what we do add in subsequent drafts. Someone is
going to check the final version and the Aug 12 draft. This is partly why
I’ve sent you the rest of this email. IPCC, me and whoever will get
accused of being political, whatever we do. As you know, I’m not
political. If anything, I would like to see the climate change happen, so
the science could be proved right, regardless of the consequences. This

Here’s an email from John, with the trend from his latest version in. Also

OK individually. The tropical ones are the key, but it is these that least is
know about except for a few regions. The sondes clearly show too much
cooling in the stratosphere (when compared to MSU4), and I reckon this
must also affect their upper troposphere trends as well. So, John may be
putting too much faith in them wrt agreement with UAH. Happy for you to
use the figure, if you don’t pass on to anyone else. Watch out for Science

with the New York Times] and what emails you copy him in on. He’s not
as predictable as we’d like

“HARRY READ ME” FILE
Among CRU’s exposed documents is the so-called “HARRY_READ_ME”
file, which served as a detailed note keeping file from 2006 through 2009 for
CRU researcher and programmer Ian “Harry” Harris. As he worked to
update and modify CRU TS2.1 to create the new CRU TS3.1dataset, the
HARRY_READ_ME.txt details Harris’s frustration with the dubious nature
of CRU’s meteorological datasets. As demonstrated through a handful of
excerpts below, the 93,000-word HARRY_READ_ME file may raise
several serious questions as to the reliability and integrity of CRU’s data
compilation and quality assurance protocols.

I am very sorry to report that the rest of the databases seem to be in nearly as
poor a state as Australia was. There are hundreds if not thousands of pairs of
dummy stations, one with no WMO and one with, usually overlapping and
with the same station name and very similar coordinates. I know it could be
old and new stations, but why such large overlaps if that’s the case?
Aarrggghhh! There truly is no end in sight.
----
One thing that’s unsettling is that many of the assigned WMo codes for
Canadian stations do not return any hits with a web search. Usually the
country’s met office, or at least the Weather Underground, show up—but for
these stations, nothing at all. Makes me wonder if these are long-
discontinued, or were even invented somewhere other than Canada!
----
OH F**K THIS. It’s Sunday evening, I’ve worked all weekend, and just
when I thought it was done I’m hitting yet another problem that’s based on the
hopeless state of our databases. There is no uniform data integrity, it’s just a
catalogue of issues that continues to grow as they’re found.
------
Here, the expected 1990-2003 period is MISSING—so the correlations
aren’t so hot! Yet the WMO codes and station names/locations are identical
(or close). What the hell is supposed to happen here? Oh yeah—there is no
‘supposed’, I can make it up. So I have :-)
------
You can’t imagine what this has cost me—to actually allow the operator to
assign false WMO codes!! But what else is there in such situations?
Especially when dealing with a ‘Master’ database of dubious provenance
(which, er, they all are and always will be).
False codes will be obtained by multiplying the legitimate code (5 digits) by
100, then adding 1 at a time until a number is found with no matches in the
database. THIS IS NOT PERFECT but as there is no central repository for
WMO codes—especially made-up ones—we’ll have to chance duplicating
one that’s present in one of the other databases. In any case, anyone
comparing WMO codes between databases—something I’ve studiously

avoided doing except for tmin/tmax where I had to—will be treating the false
codes with suspicion anyway. Hopefully.
Of course, option 3 cannot be offered for CLIMAT bulletins, there being no
metadata with which to form a new station.
This still meant an awful lot of encounters with naughty Master stations,
when really I suspect nobody else gives a hoot about. So with a somewhat
cynical shrug, I added the nuclear option— to match every WMO possible,
and turn the rest into new stations (er, CLIMAT excepted). In other words,
what CRU usually do. It will allow bad databases to pass unnoticed, and
good databases to become bad, but I really don’t think people care enough to
fix ‘em, and it’s the main reason the project is nearly a year late.
------
This whole project is SUCH A MESS. No wonder I needed therapy!!
-----
So.. we don’t have the coefficients files (just .eps plots of something). But
what are all those monthly files? DON’T KNOW, UNDOCUMENTED.
Wherever I look, there are data files, no info about what they are other than
their names. And that’s useless.. take the above example, the filenames in the
_mon and _ann directories are identical, but the contents are not. And the
only difference is that one directory is apparently ‘monthly’ and the other
‘annual’—yet both contain monthly files.
------
I find that they are broadly similar, except the normals lines (which both start
with ‘6190’) are very different. I was expecting that maybe the latter
contained 94-00 normals, what I wasn’t expecting was that are in % x10 not
%! Unbelievable—even here the conventions have not been followed. It’s
botch after botch after botch. Modified the conversion program to process
either kind of normals line.
------
The biggest immediate problem was the loss of an hour’s edits to the
program, when the network died.. no explanations from anyone, I hope it’s
not a return to last year’s troubles.

(some weeks later)
well, it compiles OK, and even runs enthusiastically. However there are
loads of bugs that I now have to fix. Eeeeek.
Timesrunningouttimesrunningout.
(even later)
Getting there.. still ironing out glitches and poor programming.
25. Wahey! It’s halfway through April and I’m still working on it. This surely
is the worst project I’ve ever attempted. Eeeek.
------
So the ‘duplicated’ figure is slightly lower.. but what’s this error with the
‘.ann’ file?! Never seen before. Oh GOD if I could start this project again
and actually argue the case for junking the inherited program suite!!
-------
Wrote ‘makedtr.for’ to tackle the thorny problem of the tmin and tmax
databases not being kept in step. Sounds familiar, if worrying. am I the first
person to attempt to get the CRU databases in working order?!! The program
pulls no punches.
---------
Back to the gridding. I am seriously worried that our flagship gridded data
product is produced by Delaunay triangulation—apparently linear as well.
As far as I can see, this renders the station counts totally meaningless. It also
means that we cannot say exactly how the gridded data is arrived at from a
statistical perspective—since we’re using an off-the-shelf product that isn’t
documented sufficiently to say that. Why this wasn’t coded up in Fortran I
don’t know—time pressures perhaps? Was too much effort expended on
homogenisation, that there wasn’t enough time to write a gridding procedure?
Of course, it’s too late for me to fix it too. Meh.
------
Now looking at the dates.. something bad has happened, hasn’t it. COBAR
AIRPORT AWS cannot start in 1962, it didn’t open until 1993! Looking at
the data—the COBAR station 1962-2004 seems to be an exact copy of the
COBAR AIRPORT AWS station 1962-2004, except that the latter has more

missing values. Now, COBAR AIRPORT AWS has 15 months of missing
value codes beginning Oct 1993.. coincidence?
--------
I am seriously close to giving up, again. The history of this is so complex that
I can’t get far enough into it before by head hurts and I have to stop. Each
parameter has a tortuous history of manual and semi-automated interventions
that I simply cannot just go back to early versions and run the update prog. I
could be throwing away all kinds of corrections—to lat/lons, to WMOs
(yes!), and more.
So what the hell can I do about all these duplicate stations? Well, how about
fixdupes.for? That would be perfect—except that I never finished it, I was
diverted off to fight some other fire. Aarrgghhh.
I—need—a—database—cleaner.
What about the ones I used for the CRUTEM3 work with Phil Brohan? Can’t
find the bugger!! Looked everywhere, Matlab scripts aplenty but not the one
that produced the plots I used in my CRU presentation in 2005. Oh, F**K IT.
Sorry. I will have to WRITE a program to find potential duplicates. It can
show me pairs of headers, and correlations between the data, and I can say
‘yay’ or ‘nay’. There is the finddupes.for program, though I think the
comment for *this* program sums it up nicely:
‘program postprocdupes2

c Further post-processing of the duplicates file—just to show how crap
the c program that produced it was! Well—not so much that but that once it
was

c running, it took 2 days to finish so I couldn’t really reset it to improve
c things. Anyway, *this* version does the following useful stuff:
c (1) Removes and squirrels away all segments where dates don’t match;
c (2) Marks segments >5 where dates don’t match;
c (3) Groups segments from the same pair of stations;
c (4) Sorts based on total segment length for each station pair’

You see how messy it gets when you actually examine the problem?
-------

Well, dtr2cld is not the world’s most complicated program. Wheras cloudreg
is, and I immediately found a mistake! Scanning forward to 1951 was done
with a loop that, for completely unfathomable reasons, didn’t include months!
So we read 50 grids instead of 600!!! That may have had something to do
with it. I also noticed, as I was correcting THAT, that I reopened the DTR
and CLD data files when I should have been opening the bloody station
files!! I can only assume that I was being interrupted continually when I was
writing this thing. Running with those bits fixed improved matters somewhat,
though now there’s a problem in that one 5-degree band (10S to 5S) has no
stations! This will be due to low station counts in that region, plus removal
of duplicate values.

WHY?

THE FORCES ARE STILL OUT THERE and, with or without President Obama, they
have the commitment and resources to achieve their Crown Jewel.
As I said in the beginning… Why?
When the United Nations is totally refuted…
When Al Gore is totally discredited…
When man-made catastrophic global warming is totally debunked… When
passing global warming cap and trade is totally futile…
Why is this book necessary?
Now you know.
